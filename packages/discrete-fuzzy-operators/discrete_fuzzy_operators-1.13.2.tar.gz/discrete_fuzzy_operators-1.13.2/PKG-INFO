FuzzyDiscreteOperators is a library to operate with discrete fuzzy
operators (discrete aggregation functions, discrete t-norms, discrete
t-conorms, discrete copulas, discrete uninorms, etc). Each family of
operators mentioned above has in turn different subfamilies; in this
library, they are also implemented as SN-implications, R-operators,
quasi-copulas, t-subnorms, etc.

Since these operators are useful in other applied fields, the library
contains the ``decision_making`` module, with emphasis on discrete fuzzy
numbers, two tuples and ordinal Yager decision functions. They are also
very useful in mathematical morphology. For more information, see
`Discrete Fuzzy
Morphology <https://github.com/mmunar97/discrete_fuzzy_morphology>`__.
