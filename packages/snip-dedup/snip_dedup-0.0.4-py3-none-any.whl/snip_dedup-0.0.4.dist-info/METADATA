SNIP is a very compact index (25GB) that has found roughly half a billion duplicates on the LAION-2B-en dataset. You may download the de-duplicated dataset below.

SNIP de-duplicated L2B on a standard home computer, taking just several days. We believe the community will benefit from such a dataset, in light of recent research showing the copyright and privacy risks associated with training generative models on highly duplicated datasets, as well as SNIP for a de-duplication, compression and retrieval tool.

## Install

```sh
pip install --upgrade snip-dedup
```

## Usage

```sh
# List available commands
snip --help
snip download --help

# Download and deduplicate the 10 first shards of the dataset
snip download --start 0 --end 10
```

Then, you may download (deduplicated) laion2b images with the awesome [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset).

You may check the fidelity of the duplicates by randomly sampling labeled duplicates, and using SNIP to detect its dup. You may do that with retrieve_dup_urls_demo.py (note you will need the original metadata files for this)

## Roadmap

You can also do with SNIP (coming soon...)
- [ ] Train SNIP Indices on your features
- [ ] Download full or sharded SNIP indices for various CLIP networks
- [ ] Do semantic search with extremely compact indices (25 GB or less) on billions of images
- [ ] Compress your features with SNIP descriptors
- [ ] Read our research paper

## About

** DISCLAIMER ** 
Use at your own risk. Help for better de-duiplication (higher acc, higher recall) is very much appreciated. Taking raw CLIP features as the ground truth for exact duplicates, we get nearly 81% precision (and likely much higher for near duplicates, see below).

We release this index for public use and exploration of the LAION-2B-en dataset (more indices coming soon). Soon we will release tools to train your own SNIP indices as well as our scientific paper discussing the method in more detail.

## Finding images overfit by Stable Diffusion

By analyzing the most duplicated images, we have found several more images verbatim copied by Stable Diffusion, posing a copyright problem:

## Note on False positives
We noticed many images labled as dup by SNIP but not by raw feats are in fact newar duplicates, for example:

## Semantic Search

SNIP can also be used for semantic search. At just 25GB, it still can return the same k-NN's compared to exhaustive search roughly a third of the time, over 2.15B database vectors. 

## Contribute

This python project uses the [`hatch`][hatch] project manager.
Dependencies are specified inside the `pyproject.toml` file, and build configs inside the `hatch.toml` file.
As such you can enter the isolated development environment with `hatch shell` from inside the repository.

To avoid silly mistakes, the code is checked with [pyright][pyright].
To ensure a consistent styling, all python code is formatted with [black][black] and we use the [ruff][ruff] linter.
Once you have installed them, you can check that the code is consistent with:

```sh
hatch run check  # check for mistakes via static analysis
hatch run format # check formatting of all python files
hatch run lint   # check linting rules
```

TODO: check pyright, formatting and linter in CI

[ ] CI
[ ] check max file size on CI to prevent pushing data
[ ] add docs. numpy docstring standard https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html
[ ] auto publish github action. example at https://github.com/ofek/hatch-showcase/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml
[ ] add tests?
