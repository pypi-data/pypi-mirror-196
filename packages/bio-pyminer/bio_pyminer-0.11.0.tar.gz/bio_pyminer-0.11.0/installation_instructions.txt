GLOBAL INSTALL:
##############################
PyMINEr has been developed and tested on Ubuntu versions 14 and 16; however it will also work on other Linux platforms if Anaconda is installed first.

For non-Ubuntu platforms download and install Anaconda:
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

All users should then proceed to install PyMINEr by opening a terminal and typing:
sudo bash ~/Downloads/pyminer/PyMINEr_install.sh

or whatever the path is to the PyMINEr_install.sh file. If all other files are kept in place, the installation should go smoothly.

LOCAL INSTALL:
##############################
If you want to install PyMINEr locally (i.e.: you're working on a cluster or something like that), you will need to:
(1) install the dependencies with your local version of python3:
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

(2) unzip the files in the lib directory:
gunzip lib/*

(3) change the path variable to include the :
PATH = </path/to/pyminer/bin/>:$PATH

##
To run PyMINEr locally, there is one modification to the command line as well.
Because you're running it locally, the STRINGdb interaction files are not located in the default location (/usr/local/lib/cell_signals/). You'll therefore have to add the directory of the lib path from #2 to your input command line call.
-string_db_dir /path/to/pyminer/lib/

USING DOCKER
##############################
I've recently put up a bleeding edge of PyMINEr on docker. In theory, this should work on any kind of machine regardless of OS, as long as you have docker working.

Install docker:
sudo apt-get install docker.io

Pull the PyMINEr image:
sudo docker pull scottyler89/pyminer

To start it & mount your directory that has your files in it, you can do something like this:
sudo docker run -it --name first_try -v /directory/that/has/input/data_files:/data scottyler89/pyminer
cd /data/
pyminer.py -i what_ever_your_file_is.txt
