    When we want to calculate the FTE of an employee, we do it for a specific
    month since this can change.

     Rules:
         - If the date we want to calculate the FTE is from the current
           month into the future, then we will take the FTE value returned
           by the Success factor Bigquery table.
         - If for the month we want to calculate the FTE is prior to
           the current one and it already has a value in the Capacity
           table, this means that it was already calculated and we will
           use that value.

     args:
        successfactor (dict): BigQuery results from the successfactor table.
        employeeFTE (dict): Bigquery results from the Capacity table.
