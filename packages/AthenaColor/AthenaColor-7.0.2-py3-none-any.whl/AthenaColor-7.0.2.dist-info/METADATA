## Package Details
#### Details and features 
A *No Dependency* Python package do display text styling in a console.
- Next to the full ability to use ANSI styling options, commonly used HTML color names are defined as default colors for Fore- and Background color styling
  - The color option are available permitting the console can take advantage of RGB ANSI codes
  - For a full list of all 140 out of the box available colors, go to [the full documentation](https://publish.obsidian.md/directiveathena/Content/Programming/AthenaColor/Documentation/HTML+Named+Colors)
  - By using the `RGB` object, you have access to print any RGB color to the console you desire
- Uses a similar syntax to Colorama, but also allows for nested function patterns

#### Python Version
- Supported Python versions: **3.7**, **3.8**, **3.9**, **3.10**
  - Other older versions of Python are not currently supported. 
  - These older versions will probably not be supported by [@AndreasSas](https://github.com/AndreasSas) himself, but if you want to contribute to the project and make this package compatible with older versions of Python, Pull requests are always welcome.

## Quick Examples
**Inline styling**:
```python
from AthenaColor import Fore, Style

print(  
    f"""  
    {Style.Italic}{Fore.SlateGray}AthenaColor Example:{Style.NoForeground}
    {Fore.Red}This is an of {Style.Bold}EXAMPLE{Style.NoBold} nested styling{Style.NoForeground}    
    {Fore.SlateGray}As you can see, the color needs to be manually returned here{Style.NoForeground}{Style.NoItalic}
    """  
)
```
**Nested Styling**:
```python
from AthenaColor import ForeNest, StyleNest

print(  
   StyleNest.Italic(ForeNest.SlateGray(  
       "AthenaColor Example:",  
       ForeNest.Red(  
           "This is an",  
           StyleNest.Bold("EXAMPLE"),  
           "of nested styling"  
       ),    
       "As you can see, a reset of color doesn't need to happen as this is done automatically",
       sep="\n"  
   ))  
)
```
