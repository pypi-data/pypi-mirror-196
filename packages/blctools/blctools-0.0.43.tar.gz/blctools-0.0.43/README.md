    - consolidado attribute now holds all the original data, but resampled to the users' input sample rate, excluding categorical variables
    - consultar_equipos_parque() and consultar_equipos_parque_no_agrupamientos() are now called consultar_equipos() and consultar_equipos_no_agrupamientos()
    - __iec61400_preparar_df_vacio_minutal() and it's aux methods are now more efficient
    - Added variables "Gen", "Con", "Pos" as boolean series for each equipment, into the datos_seg dataframe

    - Fixed bug: 10s pre-processing: Wind_dir_r was not being saved correctly for 'PLANT' element on self.datos_seg
    - Fixed bug: 10 second data is now being completed (in case of missing 10second records) with null values. This could have lead to serious problems when 
    - Fixed bug: On many methods. From pandas >= 1.5.0 numpy series where linked and not copied when creating a new df. This created many bugs throughout the whole program. 
    - unloading incidents to the 10 second data, since the main mechanism behind it is selection trhough .loc[t_stamp,:] 
* **TablasVC()**
    - Added attributes .habilitaciones and .tipohabilitaciones which are new tables of "datos básicos". They contain COD related information of each plant
    - Added .consultar_cod(nemo_parque='',uc='') function, to quickly find out about a plant's COD (Birthday) date (grabs from the table above)
    - Added .consultar_año_op(fecha_actual,feca_cod) function. Returns the contractual year (Contractual age) of a power plant
    - Added .__crear_dict_tipo_empresa(). Which fills in thre internal attributes: _empresas_bop, _empresas_gen, _empresas_grid
    - Fixed bug: .consultar() would fetchdatos_basicos from offline file even when 'online' parameter was set. This was due to:
      -  a logic error of variable db_off inside .consultar()
      -  the order in which instructions were executed
    - Fixed bug: __procesar_incidencias_it2() wasn't executing properly when cargar_datos_basicos = 'offline' was set. Solved by calling the new function .__crear_dict_tipo_empresa() before business mapping
    - Fixed bug: Desconecting twice from DB when fetching incidencias
    - Fixed bug: __combinar_incidencias_locales_y_online() wasn't working properly. Duplicate dropping should only be done by 'ID'
    - Refactored __asignar_datos() .method, to make it modular per table

    - Fixed bug when truying to export specific reports through the generating functions (ie elaborar_curvas_de_potencia, interpretar_bajo_iec61400, etc.) and seeting the "exportar" parameter to True
    - Fixed bug. PI wasn't being correctly calculated. (* instead of / was being used)
    - Added "filtro_n" parameter to .elaborar_curvas_de_potencia(), to only show results with an n_count >= n per bin. Default 0 (deactivated)
    - Added feature. Ppos is being calculated if column doesn't exist, based on Curvas_de_potencia.xlsx on BLC's cloud under blc.get_dc_cfg() directory

    - "solo_CROM" initializing parameter was removed (little use for it)
* **TablasVC()**
    - Improved the processing of incidents, now "Origin" is "NA" and np.nan resistent. Default = "INT"

    - Refactored processing of incidents, it's more readable now

## Version 0.0.15

    - "curvas_de_potencia" parameter added while initializing, to force power curves to be computed automatically
    - .elaborar_curvas_de_potencia() is now more resistent to failures. Powercurves can be elaborated without having to process incidents before, although not recommended if user doesn't know what he is doing.
    - changed how __renombrar_lvl0() works, now it must be feed the equipment names.
* **TablasVC()**
    - fixed a bug, where .consultar_equipos_parque_no_agrupamientos would return "PLANT" twice for GRIOEO
    - "cargar_incidencias" and "cargar_datos_basicos" parameters added while initializing, with possible values being [Flase, True, 'offline', 'online']
    - now queries per default active incidents from the 1st day of two months prior to today (if True or 'online' values where passed to "cargar_incidencias" parameter). Then concatenates obtained results with offline results (if there are any).

## Version 0.0.14
* **TablasVC()**
    - Fixed bug: Corrected functions that took equipments from blctools.TablasVC().conjuntogeneradores, now reading from .tipoequipo
    - Fixed bug: Now Parks without any grouping of it's generators can return the generators without grouping. Special Case: PEGARCIG
* **SQLConnector()**
    - now decrypts login data from BLC's secure fileserver.
* **DatosCROM()**
    - .consultar_equipos_parque() now retrieves the right elements if the plant doesn't havy any other grouping stages
    - .consultar_equipos_por_agrupamiento() now returns an empty list if the plant doesn't havy any other grouping stages
    - .rpt_consolidado(granularidad='1D') was added.
    -  "forzar_reprocesamiento" parameter added while initializing, to force re-process 10 second data.
    - .rpt_curvas_de_potencia() was added
    - changed the behaviour of .fecha_i and .fecha_i setters. They now attempt to update "incidencias" and "archivos" depending on the values of fecha_i and fecha_f, but the setters dont try to order the dates automatically, which lead to an unwanted behaviour.
    - Changed completely how DatosCROM() now proceses raw data (10 seconds and Incidencias). It's more efficient, and the heavy lifting occurs while processing the 10-second data. Now index has 1 column (Time) and columns have a 3 level structure (p,e,v) = Park, Element, Variable

## Version 0.0.13
* Created SQLConnector class to migrate to SQLAlchemy
* blctools.TablasVC now inherits from SQLConnector

* No more unnecessary warnings on changing the "filtro" parameter
* Function blctools.fechas.mes_dia_1() and blctools.fechas.mes_ult_dia() now validate dates using blctools.fechas.validar_fechas()
* Functions blctools.fechas.validar_fecha() and .validar_fechas() now have a parameter "prevenir_futuro=True" as default, to prevent future dates or not.
* Fixed a bug, when changing "filtro" on functions of child classes of DTE() or PPO(), download and extraction directories wouldn't update properly.
