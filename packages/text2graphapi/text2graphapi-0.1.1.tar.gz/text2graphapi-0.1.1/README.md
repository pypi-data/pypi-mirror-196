# text2graph-API
Use this library for text-to-graph tranformations. To use the API it is necessary to install its modules and dependencies  in the userâ€™s application. Also, the corpus of text documents to be transformed into graphs has to be loaded and read.

 **text2graphapi** is a text to graph transformation pipeline that consists of four main modules::
* **Text Preprocessing and Normalization**. This module aims to
perform all the cleaning and pre-processing part of the text. Apply NLP methods such as POS-Tag, Lemm, Stem, etc.
* **Graph Model**. This module aims to define the entities/nodes and
their relationships/edges according to the problem specification.
* **Graph Extraction**. This module aims to build the graph according
to the selected model. We use third-party libraries such as NetworkX.
* **Graph Transformation and Analysis**. This module aims to apply
vector transformations to the graph as final output, such as adjacency
matrix, dense matrix, etc.


**_Where to get it_**
```Python
# from PYPI
pip install text2graphapi
```

**_Example input data_**
```Python
# Has to be a list of dict, where ecah dict conatins an 'id' and 'doc' text data
input_text_docs = [{"id": 1, "doc": "text_data_1"},
                   {"id": 2, "doc": "text_data_2"}]
```

**_How to use it_**
```Python
from text2graphapi.src.Cooccurrence import Cooccurrence

to_cooccurrence = Cooccurrence(
                graph_type = 'DiGraph', 
                apply_prep = True, 
                parallel_exec = False,
                window_size = 1, 
                language = 'en',
                output_format = 'adj_matrix')
                
output_text_graphs = to_cooccurrence.transform(corpus_docs)
```
