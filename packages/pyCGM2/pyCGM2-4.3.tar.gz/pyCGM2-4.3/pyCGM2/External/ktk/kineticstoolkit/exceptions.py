    Check that a function's arguments are of correct type.

    ----------
    function
        The function to be checked.

    args
        Usually, locals(). Those are the arguments of the function.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError

    -------
    This function does not check into constructs such as lists or dicts.
    It does not check for ArrayLike. It may help users finding some bugs in
