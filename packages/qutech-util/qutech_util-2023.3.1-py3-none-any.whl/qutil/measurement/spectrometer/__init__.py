"""This module provides the :class:`~core.Spectrometer` class for
spectrum estimation using general-purpose acquisition hardware. The
class manages the acquisition, processing, as well as displaying of
acquired data.

An object of the :class:`~core.Spectrometer` class is instantiated with
two callables, ``setup()`` and ``acquire()``, that are generated by the
thin wrappers around hardware drivers in :mod:`daq`. Conceptually,
``setup()`` should configure the hardware for data acquisition given a
dictionary of settings, while ``acquire()`` should execute said
acquisition and yield an array of data when called. Furthermore, a
custom estimator for the power spectral density can be supplied, which
could for instance perform some processing of the Fourier-transformed
data before computing the spectrum using the conventional Welch's
method, or use some other method of spectral estimation.

To give a better idea of what these functions should do without delving
into the source code, we outline how to implement them for the example
of a vibration measurement here. Assume the measurement device outputs
a voltage that is proportional to the acceleration, and we would like
to obtain the displacement spectrum::

    from qutil.signal_processing.real_space import welch

    def psd_estimator(taccel, **settings):
        '''PSD estimator for displacement profile from acceleration.'''
        def accel_to_displ(a, f, **settings):
            # Integration in Fourier space corresponds to division by Ï‰
            return a/(2*np.pi*f)**2
        return welch(taccel, fourier_procfn=accel_to_displ), f

    def daq_setup(**settings):
        # Configure the hardware through some driver representing the
        # device by the daq object.
        daq.setup(...)
        # We may modify settings here, for instance to account for
        # hardware constraints.
        return settings

    def daq_acquire(**settings):
        for _ in settings.get('n_avg', 1):
            yield daq.measure()  # Returns ndarray with data

We can then instantiate a :class:`~core.Spectrometer` object like so::

    from qutil.measurement.spectrometer import Spectrometer

    spect = Spectrometer(daq_setup, daq_acquire, psd_estimator)

Spectra can then be acquired using the :meth:`~core.Spectrometer.take`
method, which takes as arguments a comment to identify the spectrum by
as well as keyword-argument pairs of settings that are passed through
to :func:`daq_setup`, :func:`daq_acquire`, and :func:`psd_estimator`::

    settings = {'f_max': 1234.5}
    spect.take('a comment', n_avg=5, **settings)

For the default PSD estimator
(:func:`qutil.signal_processing.real_space.welch`), a dictionary
subclass exists, :class:`daq.settings.DAQSettings`, which manages the
interdependencies of parameters for data acquisition. For example,
``f_max`` cannot be larger than half the sampling rate ``fs`` due to
Nyquist's theorem. See the class docstring for those special
parameters.

Spectra can be hidden from the current display and shown again::

    spect.hide(0)
    spect.show('a comment')  # same as spect.show(0)

A run can also be serialized to disk and recalled at a later point::

    spect.serialize_to_disk('./foo')
    spect_loaded = Spectrometer.recall_from_disk('./foo')
    spect_loaded.print_keys()
    (0, 'a comment')
    spect_loaded.print_settings('a comment')
    Settings for key (0, 'a'):
    {...}

Finally, plot options can be changed dynamically at runtime::

    spect.plot_raw = True  # Updates the figure accordingly
    spect.plot_timetrace = False

See the documentation of :class:`~core.Spectrometer` and its methods
for more information.
