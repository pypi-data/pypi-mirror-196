# W503: "line break before binary operator", you have to choose between W503 and W504,
#   I prefer to have the operator at the begining of the newline
# E402: "module level import not at top of file" debatable
# SIM106: "handle error case first"
#   while I see the point, it may lead to weird contorsion of the branches
#   sometimes
# R504: "you shouldn`t assign value to variable if it will be use only as return value"
#   good idea in principle but it does not detect when eventually effectful code 
#   is found between the affectation and the return
# E203: "E203 whitespace before ':'"
#   Actually a good one, but clashes with Black in the case of slices
