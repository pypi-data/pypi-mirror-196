Alternatively, a tutorial video is also available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfasBlJHKIg">here</a> as reference.\n\n## Requirements\nCyber SDK requires <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python v3.7+</a>.\n\n## Installation\n\n<sub>**NOTE:** *All code starting with a `$` is meant to run on your terminal (a bash prompt). All code starting with a `>>>` is meant to run in a python interpreter, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ipython/">ipython</a>.*</sub>\n\nCyber SDK can be installed (preferably in a `virtual environment` from PyPI using `pip`) as follows:\n```bash\n$ pip install -U cyber_sdk\n```\n<sub>*You might have `pip3` installed instead of `pip`; proceed according to your own setup.*<sub>\n\n## Dependencies\nCyber SDK uses <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> to manage dependencies. To get set up with all the required dependencies, run:\n```bash\n$ pip install poetry\n$ poetry install\n```\n\n\n## Tests\nCyber SDK provides extensive tests for data classes and functions. To run them, after the steps in [Dependencies](#dependencies):\n```bash\n$ make test\n```\n\n## Code Quality\nCyber SDK uses <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Black</a>, <a href="https://isort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">isort</a>, and <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Mypy</a> for checking code quality and maintaining style. To reformat, after the steps in [Dependencies](#dependencies):\n```bash\n$ make qa && make format\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n# Usage Examples\nCyber SDK can help you read block data, sign and send transactions, deploy and interact with contracts, and many more.\nThe following examples are provided to help you get started. Use cases and functionalities of the Cyber SDK are not limited to the following examples and can be found in full <a href="https://savetheales.github.io/cyber.py/index.html">here</a>.\n\nIn order to interact with the Cyber blockchain, you\'ll need a connection to a Cyber node. This can be done through setting up an LCDClient (The LCDClient is an object representing an HTTP connection to a Cyber LCD node.):\n\n```python\nfrom cyber_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient\ncyber = LCDClient(chain_id="bostrom", url="https://lcd.bostrom.cybernode.ai/")\n```\n\n## Getting Blockchain Information\n\nOnce properly configured, the `LCDClient` instance will allow you to interact with the Cyber blockchain. Try getting the latest block height:\n\n\n```python\ncyber.tendermint.block_info()[\'block\'][\'header\'][\'height\']\n```\n\n`\'5490476\'`\n\n\n### Async Usage\n\nIf you want to make asynchronous, non-blocking LCD requests, you can use AsyncLCDClient. The interface is similar to LCDClient, except the module and wallet API functions must be awaited.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio \nfrom cyber_sdk.client.lcd import AsyncLCDClient\n\nasync def main():\n      cyber = AsyncLCDClient("https://lcd.bostrom.cybernode.ai/", "bostrom")\n      total_supply = await cyber.bank.total()\n      print(total_supply)\n      await cyber.session.close # you must close the session\n\nasyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())\n```\n\n## Building and Signing Transactions\n\nIf you wish to perform a state-changing operation on the cyber blockchain such as sending tokens, swapping assets, withdrawing rewards, or even invoking functions on smart contracts, you must create a **transaction** and broadcast it to the network.\nCyber SDK provides functions that help create StdTx objects.\n\n### Example Using a Wallet (*recommended*)\n\nA `Wallet` allows you to create and sign a transaction in a single step by automatically fetching the latest information from the blockchain (chain ID, account number, sequence).\n\nUse `LCDClient.wallet()` to create a Wallet from any Key instance. The Key provided should correspond to the account you intend to sign the transaction with.\n\n\n```python\nfrom cyber_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient\nfrom cyber_sdk.key.mnemonic import MnemonicKey\n\nmk = MnemonicKey(mnemonic=MNEMONIC) \ncyber = LCDClient("https://lcd.bostrom.cybernode.ai/", "bostrom")\nwallet = cyber.wallet(mk)\n```\n\nOnce you have your Wallet, you can simply create a StdTx using `Wallet.create_and_sign_tx`.\n\n\n```python\nfrom cyber_sdk.core.fee import Fee\nfrom cyber_sdk.core.bank import MsgSend\nfrom cyber_sdk.client.lcd.api.tx import CreateTxOptions\n\ntx = wallet.create_and_sign_tx(CreateTxOptions(\n        msgs=[MsgSend(\n            wallet.key.acc_address,\n            RECIPIENT,\n            "1000000boot"    # send 1_000_000 BOOT\n        )],\n        memo="test transaction!",\n        fee=Fee(200000, "20000boot")\n    ))\n```\n\nYou should now be able to broadcast your transaction to the network.\n\n```python\nresult = bostrom.tx.broadcast(tx)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n# Contributing\n\nCommunity contribution, whether it\'s a new feature, correction, bug report, additional documentation, or any other feedback is always welcome. Please read through this section to ensure that your contribution is in the most suitable format for us to effectively process.\n\n<br/>\n\n## Reporting an Issue \nFirst things first: **Do NOT report security vulnerabilities in public issues!** Please disclose responsibly by submitting your findings to the [Bostrom Bugcrowd submission form](https://www.bostrom.money/bugcrowd).
