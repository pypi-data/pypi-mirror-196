              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

# Boto Endpoint URL shim

Configure `boto3` and `botocore` endpoint URL via environment variables or
shared configuration file.

This project is motivated by the yet-to-be-merged [`boto3` PR#2746][1], and
follows the [`aws-sdk` proposal #230][2] (updated for commit [`b912470`][3]).

## Quick start

To use the main interface described in [proposal #230][2], set up either
service-specific environment variables or `endpoint_url` in a service-specific
sub-section of the shared configuration file and set up the proposed endpoint
URL resolution.

```py
import boto_endpoint_url_shim
import boto3

boto_endpoint_url_shim.proposed_endpoint_url_resolution()

s3 = boto3.resource("s3")  # uses custom endpoint URL
```

## Endpoint URL resolution order

The core functionality of this package is exposed through the
`proposed_endpoint_url_resolution` function which sets up the proposed endpoint
resolution order of [proposal #230][2]:

1. `endpoint_url` keyword argument
    ```py
    import boto3
    boto3.resource("s3", endpoint_url="http://localhost:8088")
    ```
1. configuration via service-specific environment variable
1. configuration via global environment variable
1. configuration via service sub-sections of the shared configuration file
1. configuration via global parameter in shared configuration file
1. fallback to default endpoint determination of `botocore`

The first truthy value provided by one of the steps will be used as endpoint URL
for the clients and resources, otherwise the resolution continues to the next
step.

Any other endpoint URL resolution order, can be set up using the
`custom_endpoint_url_resolution` function, with passing the configuration
functions as variadic arguments in the order they should be used.

```py
boto_endpoint_url_shim.custom_endpoint_url_resolution(step1, step2, ..., stepN)
```

## Endpoint URL configuration options

### Proposed interface

The [proposal #230][2] includes four main methods for endpoint resolution, two
service-specific endpoint configuration and two global.

This main interface can be set up using `proposed_endpoint_url_resolution()`.

#### Configuration via service-specific environment variable

Implementation: `read_service_env_var`.

Read the configuration from environment variables
`AWS_<SERVICE_ID>_ENDPOINT_URL` in which `<SERVICE_ID>` is the `ServiceId` of
the of a specific service as defined in its `ServiceModel`, transformed with
spaces replaced with underscores and letters upper-cased.

```sh
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_DYNAMODB=http://localhost:8024
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_ELASTIC_BEANSTALK=http://localhost:8053
```

#### Configuration via global environment variable

Implementation: `read_global_env_var`.

Read the configuration from the global environment variable `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`
and use this endpoint URL for all services.

```sh
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8099
```

#### Configuration via service sub-sections of the shared configuration file

Implementation: `read_service_config_file`.

Read the configuration from the shared configuration file, as the `endpoint_url`
parameter under the `service_id` sub-section in the `services` definition. As
above, `service_id` is a transform for the `ServiceId` with spaces replaced with
underscores and letters lower-cased. The `services` definition to use is
referenced by key in the profile via the `services` parameter.

```ini
[services local-db-eb]
dynamodb =
    endpoint_url = http://localhost:8024
elastic_beanstalk =
    endpoint_url = http://localhost:8053
[profile testing]
services = local-db-eb
```

#### Configuration via global parameter in shared configuration file

Implementation: `read_global_config_file`.

Read the configuration from the `endpoint_url` parameter at the top level of a
`services` definition and use this endpoint URL for all services. The `services`
definition to use is referenced by key in the profile via the `services`
parameter.

```ini
[services local-services]
endpoint_url = http://localhost:8099
[profile testing]
services = local-services
```

### Alternative interfaces

Several more interfaces are included in the [proposal #230][1], they have been
implemented as functions in this package.

As a convenience, the proposed interface above followed by the global
environment variable and global configuration file methods can be set up using
`global_endpoint_url_resolution`.

#### Configuration via mapping in global environment variable

Implementation: `read_mapping_env_var`.

Read the configuration from the global environment variable `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`,
containing a mapping of lower-case `service_id`s to endpoint URLs.

```sh
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL="dynamodb=http://localhost:8024,elastic_beanstalk=http://localhost:8053"
```

**NB.** The mapping is loaded once on the first use of the function and cached
for later uses.

#### Configuration via named top level parameters in shared configuration file

Implementation: `read_named_top_level_config_file`.

Read the configuration from the `<service_id>_endpoint_url` parameter at the top
level of a profile, with `<service_id>` the lower-case `service_id`.

```ini
[profile local-services]
dynamodb_endpoint_url = http://localhost:8024
elastic_beanstalk_endpoint_url = http://localhost:8053
```

### Custom interface

Users are free to define and use functions to obtain the endpoint URL of a
service.

The custom functions must adhere to the following signature:

```py
def func(session: botocore.session.Session, service_id: str) -> str | None: ...
```

with:
* `session` a `botocore.session.Session`
* `service_id` the `ServiceId` of a specific service as defined in its
  `ServiceModel`, transformed with spaces replaced with underscores and letters
  lower-cased
* `returns` a `str | None` either the endpoint URL or None to continue to the
  next step in the resolution chain
