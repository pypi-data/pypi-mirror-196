##  python todo

* implement find_games - which iterates through games that also have a remotecache.vdf file.
* implement backup_game - given a game id, create a savestate from the most recent vdf snapshot.
* Make sure we handle nested files/directories properly

assume:
vdf = the vdf file json
gamedir = /home/...userdata.../accountid/gameid

if vdf.ChangeNumber is unchanged from the last backup, no change occurred.
iterate over props (except ChangeNumber and ostype).  For each prop that is an object, pull out the filename from gamedir + the prop name - copy that file.


* update restore game code to use these new style snapshots.
* add an 'undo' option to revert the most recent restore

```

Plan:
Find apps based on remotecache.vdf
Look for changes to remote rc.vdf, if file has changed, look for changes to "localtime" on the files.  If that changed record a new "versioned" backup event for that set of files.  Copy the files away

For restore, let user pick from versioned backups.

Run scan after each game exit (FIXME - how to hook this?)
Work on both desktop linux or steamdeck.

Hi,

I'm a sw dev who has really been loving my Steam Deck.  And though I like the steam cloud based backups for game saves, one particular game of mine (Valheim heh) really makes me wish I had some sort of automatic 'versioned' backups of game saves.  So that I could easily go back to an old save (even when the game doesn't provide such a feature).  

For now I've made a couple of nasty scripts for the game I most wanted this for but I have two questions for ya'll:

* Would a nice GUI based app (or decky loader plugin) that "lets you reload from any of your recent saves" be useful?
* Has anyone else already made such an app?  If so - I'd eagerly just use that instead! My googling thus far has failed though...

I've looked into the Steam backup API docs and explored around on the filesystem and I think I can make a nice mechanism that automatically works for all Steam cloud backup based games.  For games that are not steam cloud backup based I'll have a mechanism so that people can add those on their own if they wish.

Any feedback or pointers would be appreciated!

Hi decky geeks!
I've used decky and think it is slick.  I'm now investigating making a decky plug-in to provide 'roll-back' save/restore for games that use steam-cloud backups (initially, possibly other games later).  I've read the Steam
docs and looked at remotecache.vdf files on my steamdeck and I think I can make a pretty friendly & safe tool for novice users.

I've written a fair amount of JS and python stuff but I do have some questions on decky.  Any feedback or pointers would be appreciated:

* Does decky already provide the appid to name mappings for games somewhere? I could scrape ...steam/debian-installation/steamapps/appmanifest_*.vcf but I assume this has been needed already and I wouldn't want to scrape again.  If you don't already have such a service, would you like me to send this in as a PR somehow or would you rather me just leave it in my plugin.
* Does decky have any hooks/callbacks/whatever I can use to be notified when an app has been launched/exited from the Steam UI?
* I assume for my 'backend' of my plugin I should write it in python because that's the preferred backend language in decky land?
* How do you develop/test your decky plugins?  Is it possible to run plugins on my linux desktop in Steam big-picture mode?

appStore global

various Register* functions in SteamClient. they return an object {unregister: f ()} which you MUST store and later call in your plugin's onDismount to prevent major issues when your plugin is updated

ok coolbeans - I'll look in the SteamClient code to see if someone already has the remotecache stuff.  If not there I'll try to add something that fits nicely. 
SteamClient is an interface created from native steam client code
we only have the interface itself, cant view its source code
look at our existing typings for it at https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-frontend-lib/blob/main/src/deck-components/SteamClient.ts and browse it by evaluating it in the Console tab of the CEF DevTools
