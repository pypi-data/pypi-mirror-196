algorithm:
iterate over f = await window.SteamClient.InstallFolder.GetInstallFolders()....strFolderPath

for each of those paths look in:

$ROOT/steamapps/common/$AppDisplayName/...steam_autocloud.vdf 
and
$ROOT/steamapps/compatdata/$AppIdNum/...steam_autocloud.vdf
to find root dirs for backup/restore. 

let's call that dir (that had the autocloud file) $ACROOT

for subnautica that would be:
/home/kevinh/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/Subnautica/SNAppData/SavedGames/

Looking at the first entry in the subnautica remotecache.vdf file (call this $RCREF):

SNAppData/SavedGames/options/9e07478a181f6adcb95db7db8b075d74b394f2c7-options.bin

Find the directory names that are common to both the TAIL of $ACROOT and the HEAD of $RCREF.  Call this $RCCOMMON

SNAppData/SavedGames/

remove $RCCOMMON from the tail of $ACROOT to be the new game backup root (similar to the 'remote' directory when that directory is present):

/home/kevinh/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/Subnautica

Using this directory as the root you can now apply paths mentioned in remotecache successfully!

xcom2 has four ACROOTS

/home/kevinh/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/268500/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/my games/XCOM2 War of the Chosen/XComGame/SaveData/
/home/kevinh/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/268500/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/my games/XCOM2/XComGame/SaveData/
/home/kevinh/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/268500/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents BACKUP/my games/XCOM2 War of the Chosen/XComGame/SaveData
/home/kevinh/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/268500/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents BACKUP/my games/XCOM2/XComGame/SaveData


in that case we scan through the candidates to find the longest $RCCOMON we can find:

my games/XCOM2/XComGame/SaveData/

This leaves us with two candidates:

/home/kevinh/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/268500/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/my games/XCOM2/XComGame/SaveData/
/home/kevinh/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/268500/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents BACKUP/my games/XCOM2/XComGame/SaveData

we should reject doing backups on this game because we can't know which dir.
