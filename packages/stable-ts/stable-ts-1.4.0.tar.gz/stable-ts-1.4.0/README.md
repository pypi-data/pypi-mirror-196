# Stabilizing Timestamps for Whisper

## Description
This script modifies and adds more robust decoding logic on top of OpenAI's Whisper to produce more accurate segment-level timestamps and obtain to word-level timestamps without extra inference.

## Setup
```
pip install -U stable-ts
```

To install the lastest commit:
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/jianfch/stable-ts.git
```

### Command-line usage
Transcribe audio then save result as JSON file.
```commandline
stable-ts audio.mp3 -o audio.json
```
Processing JSON file of the results into ASS.
```commandline
stable-ts audio.json -o audio.ass
```
Transcribe multiple audio files then process the results directly into SRT files.
```commandline
stable-ts audio1.mp3 audio2.mp3 audio3.mp3 -o audio1.srt audio2.srt audio3.srt
```
Show all available arguments and help.
```commandline
stable-ts -h
```

### Python usage
```python
import stable_whisper

model = stable_whisper.load_model('base')
# modified model should run just like the regular model but accepts additional parameters
results = model.transcribe('audio.mp3')
```

```python
# the above uses default settings on version 1.1 with large model
# sentence/phrase-level
stable_whisper.results_to_sentence_srt(results, 'audio.srt')
```

```python
# the above uses default settings on version 1.1 with large model
# sentence/phrase-level & word-level
stable_whisper.results_to_sentence_word_ass(results, 'audio.ass')
```
#### Additional Info
* Although timestamps are chronological, they can still very inaccurate depending on the model, audio, and parameters.
* To produce production ready word-level results, the model needs to be fine-tuned with high quality dataset of audio with word-level timestamp.
