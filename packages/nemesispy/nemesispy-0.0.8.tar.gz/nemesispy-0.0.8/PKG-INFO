This package contains tool for simulating exoplanet atmospheric
emission spectra with the correlated-k method. There are a few demos 
in the nemesispy folder. In particular, if you run 
python3 demo_fit_eclipse.py in the terminal, an interactive plot
window will (hopefully) show up so you could try fitting an 
eclipse spectrum of a hot Jupiter manually and constrain its
atmospheric properties. 

In order to install the package but still make it editable, type the
following in the terminal:

pip install --editable .
