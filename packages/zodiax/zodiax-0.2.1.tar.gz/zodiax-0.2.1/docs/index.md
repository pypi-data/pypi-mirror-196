`Zodiax` is a lightweight extension to the object-oriented `jax` package `equinox`, designed to to simplify working with pytrees for scientific data analysis, adding extra functionality to make working with optimisation and inference libraries like `optax` and `NumPyro` easy. If you are unfamiliar with `Jax` and `equinox` we strongly reccomend reading the [Jax 101 tutorials](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/index.html) and the [equinox docs](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/) to get an idea. 

`Zodiax` provides classes that extend the `equinox.Module` class with a series of convenience methods that make working with and optimising complex nested class structures easy. It was built to facilitate [`dLux`](https://louisdesdoigts.github.io/dLux/), a fully differentiable optical modelling framework, and spun out into its own package to aid others in building the next generation of powerful scientific programming tools that harness automatic differentiation.
