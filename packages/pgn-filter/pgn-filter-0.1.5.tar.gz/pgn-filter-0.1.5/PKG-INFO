# pgn-filter

A small program to query for games inside PGN documents.

You can supply basic queries using command line arguments
and you can write more advanced queries using python scripts.

# Example queries
## Games starting with d4
```python
from chess import Move

def query(game):
    first_move = list(game.mainline_moves())
    if first_move[0] == Move.from_uci("d2d4"):
        return True
    return False
```
## Games with no castling moves
```python
from chess import Board

def query(game):
    board = Board()
    for move in game.mainline_moves():
    if board.is_castling(move):
        return False
    return True
```

# Installation instructions
```bash
pip install pgn-filter
```
