    Creates a wait_for_slot-callable that will let through at least one concurrent job, and additional jobs as
    long as `required` cpu:s are idle. It is cgroup-aware, and will not allow current process and subprocesses to
    consume more CPU than configured cgroup-limit.

    When a worker is spawned, but before it has received its job request, it will have the CPU amount
    specified in the `required` parameter artificially reserved for it. The `keep_cpu_reservation`
    parameter can be used for jobs that when started don't immediately use the full amount of CPU that
    they will do eventually. In order to avoid spawning lots of such jobs in a short time period before
    CPU usage has settled, the artifical CPU reservation can be kept by setting `keep_cpu_reservation`
    to True. When doing this, the job should at some later point during its request processing reset the
    CPU reservation by calling the function stored under the "RESET_CPU_RESERVATION" key in the WSGI
    request environment, like so:

        http_request.environ["RESET_CPU_RESERVATION"](new_cpu_amount)

    The function may be called several times during the request processing, but the last call should
    normally set the amount to 0.
