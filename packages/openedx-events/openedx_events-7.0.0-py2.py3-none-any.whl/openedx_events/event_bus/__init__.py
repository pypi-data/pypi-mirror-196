"""
Classes and utility functions for the event bus.

This module includes the entry point for the producer.

API:

- ``get_producer`` returns an ``EventBusProducer`` singleton that should be used for sending all events
  to the Event Bus. The backing implementation is chosen via the Django setting ``EVENT_BUS_PRODUCER``.
  See for example the Kafka implementation's ``KafkaEventProducer``, with the ``create_producer`` function
  serving as the loader: https://github.com/openedx/event-bus-kafka/blob/main/edx_event_bus_kafka/internal/producer.py
