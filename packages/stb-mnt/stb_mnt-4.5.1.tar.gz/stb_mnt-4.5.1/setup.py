STB will preserve all extras, automatically set package source, and will gracefully handle any issues that might happen while updating.\n\n* To install a local version of `my_package` that is located at `../my_package`:\n\n```bash\nstb use ../my_package\n```\n\n* To install a local version of `my_package` that is located at `../my_package` in editable mode:\n\n```bash\nstb use ../my_package --editable\n```\n\n* To install a cloud version of `my_package` with tag `8.3.1`:\n\n```bash\nstb use "my_package==8.3.1"\n```\n\n* To install a cloud version of my_package with tag `8.3.1`, my_other_package with any tag higher than `1.2.3`, and my_third_package with any tag more than or equal to `4.5.6` and less than `5.0.0`:\n\n```bash\nstb use "my_package==8.3.1" "my_other_package>1.2.3" "my_third_package^4.5.6"\n```\n\n### Run\n\n* To update and run the select services concurrently:\n\n```bash\nstb run service1 service2\n```\n\n### Config\n\n* To set a git url for cloning:\n\n```bash\nstb config set git_url git@gitlab.my_company.com\n```\n\n### Graph\n\n* To get a dependency graph of your microservices:\n\n```bash\nstb graph json my_company/backend/ my_company/infrastructure/\n```\n\n* To get a dependency graph of your microservices as an svg image (requires graphviz):\n\n```bash\nstb graph graphviz my_company/backend/ my_company/infrastructure/\n```\n\n### How directories are selected for update/db\n\nFor every update, you can specify:\n\n1) A microservice directory, which will cause stb to update only that microservice\n2) Several microservice directories, which will cause stb to update these microservices and integrate them together (for example, `update ports` assigns ports to local microservices and updates their links in other microservices to match the assigned ports)\n3) A directory with multiple microservice subdirectories inside it, which is equivalent to (2) with the list of subdirectories as arguments\n4) Nothing, which will choose the current working directory as the first argument and will be equivalent to (1) or (3)\n',
