---

This Python module provides Python bindings for the official C/C++ Linkam SDK. It enables monitoring and control of various instruments provided by Linkam. Can optionally be used with the [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package to handle unit conversion.

## Installation
Note that the Linkam SDK binary files (`LinkamSDK_release.dll` or `LinkamSDK_debug.dll`) and the required license file (typically `Linkam.lsk`) are **not** distributed as part of this module.

By default the module will look for the Linkam SDK dll using the `$PATH` environment variable, appending the module directory before searching.

0. If necessary rename `LinkamSDK.dll` (used in recent versions) to `LinkamSDK_release.dll`
1. Place `LinkamSDK_release.dll` (or `LinkamSDK_debug.dll`) and `Linkam.lsk` files inside the `pylinkam` module folder (the one that contains `__init__.py`)
2. Run `demo.py` to check for any issues. This will set the stage temperature to 25°C temporarily.

## Usage
Initialise the SDK by creating an instance of `pylinkam.sdk.SDKWrapper` providing optional paths for SDK binary files and the license file. Once initialised, use the `connect()` method to create a context manager for the connection to a device.  

### Example
```python
from pylinkam import interface, sdk


with sdk.SDKWrapper() as wrapper:
    with wrapper.connect() as connection:
        print(f"Name: {connection.get_controller_name()}")
```

## Tested Devices
This library has been developed for the following Linkam instruments/addons, a check indicated that functionality has been verified on working hardware:

- [x] T96 System Controller (via USB)
- [ ] T96 System Controller (via RS-232, this might work :shrug:)
- [x] HFS600E-PB4 Probe Stage
- [x] RH95 Humidity Controller
- [ ] LNP96 Cooling Option (should work)

Only tested under Windows 10 using LinkamSDK `v3.0.5.5` and `v3.0.15.35`. In theory the SDK binary files for Linux should have identical mappings, but this hasn't been tested.
