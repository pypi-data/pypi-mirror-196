**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS MODULE IS IN BETA AND CHATBOTS CREATED WITH IT MAY RESPOND WITH UNEXPECTED ANSWERS**

### **USAGE:**
#### Import library
```from chatbot_webraft import chatbot```

##### Create Model
```chatbot.create_model("my-model")```

##### Load  CSV DATASET (here 'input' needs to be replaced with the column in dataset that has the fields containing the data to be inputted same to be done with 'label' but with fields containing the data to be outputted. )
```chatbot.dataset(CSV_FILE_NAME,'input','label',"my-model"") ```

##### Add more data to chatbot(OPTIONAL)
```chatbot.add_data("my-model"",["input1","input2"],["output1","output2"]) ```

##### Specify Input
```input = "hi"``` / ```input = input("Enter: ")```
##### Run chatbot (for default set MODEL_TYPE to "spimx")
```print(chatbot.model_load(MDDEL_TYPE,input,"my-model",MDDEL_TYPE))```/```chatbot.model_load(MDDEL_TYPE,input,"my-model",MDDEL_TYPE)``` 
##### Use codewriter (currently python supported)
```print(codewriter("python",input,"my-model","pywriter")``` / ```chatbot.model_load("pywriter",input,"my-model","pywriter")```

### **Model Types:**
Inbuilt model types: nlpm (Generative, Best) , spimx (better), spimxr (more good), spim (good), rasv (not that good)

You can use other model types by downloading them from [here]("https://models.chatbot.webraft.in") and define path where modeltype (.wrmodel) file is stored to MODEL_TYPE

NLPM: A generative model type (framework) , works best for generative bots . (BETA)
NLPM USAGE: ```chatbot.model_load("nlpm",input,"my-model",MODELTYPE)``` - Replace `MODELTYPE` with the other modeltype that suites you the best , i.e - spim , spimx , rasv , spim (do not replace MODELTYPE with 'nlpm' rather replace with others)

There is also a transformer modified framework that uses Tokenizers from prebuilt transfomer model i.e - BERT . Note that it needs very high system for running and takes a lot of time to load. USE - ```chatbot.model_load("bert",input,"my-model","bert)``` (It doesnt need training)
### **Basic BOT Usage:**
 ```
 #Import library
from chatbot_webraft import chatbot

#set model name
model = "my-model" 

#create model
chatbot.create_model(model)

#load CSV dataset , Mention input column (question) and label column (answer)
chatbot.dataset(CSV_FILE_NAME,INPUT_COLUMN,LABEL_COLUMN,model) 


#run in loop
while True:
  prompt = input("You: ")    
  #run model and parse input
  print("Bot: ",chatbot.model_load("spimx",prompt,model,"spimx")) 

 ```

 ### **Bot usage for discord:**
```
#Import libraries
from chatbot_webraft import chatbot
import discord 
client = discord.Client(intents=discord.Intents.all())


model = "my-model" #set model name
chatbot.create_model(model) #create model
chatbot.dataset(CSV_FILE_NAME,INPUT_COLUMN,LABEL_COLUMN,model) #load CSV dataset .. Mention input column (question) and label column (answer)
chatbot.add_data(model,["hey","what about you"],["hello bro","im fine ,you?"]) #add more data to model (Not saved , only in memory). Data that you may want to add later.
@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author == client.user:
        return

    prompt = message.content
    
    await message.reply(chatbot.model_load("spim",prompt,model,"spim")) #run model and parse output
client.run(BOT_TOKEN)
```
### **Basic codewriter usage:**
```
 #Import library
from chatbot_webraft import chatbot

#set model name
model = "my-model" 

#create model
chatbot.create_model(model)

#load CSV dataset , Mention input column (question) and label column (answer)
chatbot.dataset(CSV_FILE_NAME,INPUT_COLUMN,LABEL_COLUMN,model) 


#run in loop
while True:
  prompt = input("You: ")    
  #run model and parse input
  print("Bot: ",chatbot.model_load("pywriter",prompt,model,"pywriter")) #Or codewriter("python",prompt,model,"pywriter")
```

### **SAMPLE CSV DATASET:**
Download Sample csv dataset from [here](https://webraft.in/sample.csv) , Dont forget to put the file in your project directory
<br>
Change `CSV_FILE_NAME` to "sample.csv" , `INPUT_COLUMN` to "input" , `LABEL_COLUMN` to "label" in the code

### **Errors:**
Error 1 - This error indicates that the model name used in specific function is not same as the modelname set with chatbot.createmodel() 
<br>
Error 2 - This error indicates that the codewriter couldn't convert specific text to code due to lack of resources 
<br>
Error 3 - This error indicates that the file being set in any of these functions: chatbot.dataset() , chatbot.model_load() doesn't exist
