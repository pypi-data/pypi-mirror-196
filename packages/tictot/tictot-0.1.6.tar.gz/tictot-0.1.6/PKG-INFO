![Showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniarlert/tictot/master/assets/showcase.gif)


tictot is a simple time tracker for the terminal that is easy and fast to use. With tictot you can track the time spent on different tasks and keep a record of your worked hours. The application is built with [textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), an awesome framework for building applications for the terminal.
tictot is also inspired by the [textual's example application](https://textual.textualize.io/tutorial/).

## Work in progress

For the moment tictot only supports tracking time for a single task at a time. It also doesn't support tags, categories or any other fancy stuff. Also you can't update past entries or delete them. But I'm working on it.

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install tictot
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniarlert/tictot.git
```

Now, install the application:

```bash
cd tictot && pip install .
```


## To Do

- [ ] Update past entries.
- [ ] Delete entries.
- [ ] Support tags.
- [ ] Support user configuration.
- [ ] Statistics.
