# OIDIA

## Introduction

OIDIA is a simple terminal-based streak tracker, written in Python using
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).

By simple I *mean* simple. There's no shaming and streak counting and all
that stuff; it just lets you record what you've done, what days you've done
it on, and how many times you did it on those days.

That's it.

No judgement.

## Usage

I aim to add a help screen so that the keys etc will be visible within the
application. Hopefully though most features can be found from the footer or
are easily discovered. The main points are:

- <kbd>a</kbd> adds a new streak
- <kbd>Ctrl+d</kbd> deletes a new streak
- <kbd>Ctrl+Up</kbd> moves a streak up
- <kbd>Ctrl+Down</kbd> moves a streak down
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> edits the title of a streak
- <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>=</kbd> increase the count for a day
- <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>-</kbd> decrease the count for a day
- <kbd>[</kbd> zooms the timeline in
- <kbd>]</kbd> zooms the timeline out

## TODO

- [ ] Add a help screen
