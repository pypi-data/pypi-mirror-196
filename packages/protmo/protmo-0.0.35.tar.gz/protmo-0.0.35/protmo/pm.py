    If you look closely, you see, that the second is actually a function
    call.

    We have to detect and handle both cases. When it its a function call
    it "peels off" one layer, thus we have to return a result with one
    layer more.

    To detecht, if @rpc or @rpc(...) was used we use
    ```
    len(args) == 1 and callable(args[0]):
    ```
    In this case, there are no arguments, thus we just add the method to
    the methods to remember and are finished

    Otherwise, we use inner_gen to wrap the result in another layer and
    pass the arguments to make them accessible to inner (within inner_gen).
    `inner` is called then with the method as argument. Now we have the
    function-pointer AND the parameters in the body of inner. Now we can
    add the parameters to the _rpcs_methods

    def unpack(method):

        Staticmethods are wrapped. To get the real function-pointer,
        we have to use the __func__ methos. This helper returns the
        function pointer to the given method while handling this.

# TODO: this does not have a function. The reason, why it is, was that we can use
#       stream(Type). But this is not deprecated, as this does not work with
#       from __future__ import annotations. We now use stream[Type]
def stream(T: type) -> Generator:
    '''
    This is a helper method to express in the model, that you either
    expect a stream or result one. Example:

    @rpc
    def greetInDifferentWays(self, requests : stream(str)) -> str:
        ...

    or

    @rpc
    def userInfoStream(self) -> stream(str):
        ...

    It is kind of syntactical sugar, as we only want to carry along
    the type T and the information that it is a generator. But we don't
    need the second and third argument. Thus this method, which makes
    them invisible.
    Also, it adjusts the wording, as we don't have Generators with gRPC
    but streams.

class Late:
    '''
    Sometimes, you have cyclic references, like:

    class Employee:
        patient = ReferenceField(Patient)

    class Patient:
        last_emplyee = ReferenceField(Employee)

    This does not work, as Patient is not defined when Employee
    is defined. Changing order does not help.

    To solve this, you can wrap the reference with this class:

    class Employee:
        patient = ReferenceField(Late('Patient'))

    class Patient:
        last_emplyee = ReferenceField(Employee)
