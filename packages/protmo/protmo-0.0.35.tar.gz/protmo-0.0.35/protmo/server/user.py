    The user-object wraps the JSON-data in the JWT which is set
    by keycloak and makes it accessible. The most important method
    reflecting that is the from_jwt_userinfo, where the mapping 
    happens. It is called, whenever a client connects to the server.
    Before anything happens, the AuthInterceptor checks if the JWT
    in the header is valid. Then, User.from_jwt_userinfo is called 
    and the user-instance is set into the context, so that the server
    application-code can access user-info, e.g. to add the users first
    name to a greeting.
