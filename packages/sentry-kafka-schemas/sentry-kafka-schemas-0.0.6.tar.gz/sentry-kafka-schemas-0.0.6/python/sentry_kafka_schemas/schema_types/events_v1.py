     Type of the event. Defaults to `default`.

     The event type determines how Sentry handles the event and has an impact on processing, rate
     limiting, and quotas. There are three fundamental classes of event types:

      - **Error monitoring events**: Processed and grouped into unique issues based on their
        exception stack traces and error messages.
      - **Security events**: Derived from Browser security violation reports and grouped into
        unique issues based on the endpoint and violation. SDKs do not send such events.
      - **Transaction events** (`transaction`): Contain operation spans and collected into traces
        for performance monitoring.

     Transactions must explicitly specify the `"transaction"` event type. In all other cases,
     Sentry infers the appropriate event type from the payload and overrides the stated type.
     SDKs should not send an event type other than for transactions.

     Example:

     ```json
     {
       "type": "transaction",
       "spans": []
     }

SentryRequest = Union["_SentryRequestAnyof0"]
"""
sentry_request.

 Http request information.

 The Request interface contains information on a HTTP request related to the event. In client
 SDKs, this can be an outgoing request, or the request that rendered the current web page. On
 server SDKs, this could be the incoming web request that is being handled.

 The data variable should only contain the request body (not the query string). It can either be
 a dictionary (for standard HTTP requests) or a raw request body.

 ### Ordered Maps

 In the Request interface, several attributes can either be declared as string, object, or list
 of tuples. Sentry attempts to parse structured information from the string representation in
 such cases.

 Sometimes, keys can be declared multiple times, or the order of elements matters. In such
 cases, use the tuple representation over a plain object.

 Example of request headers as object:

 ```json
 {
   "content-type": "application/json",
   "accept": "application/json, application/xml"
 }
 ```

 Example of the same headers as list of tuples:

 ```json
 [
   ["content-type", "application/json"],
   ["accept", "application/json"],
   ["accept", "application/xml"]
 ]
 ```

 Example of a fully populated request object:

 ```json
 {
   "request": {
     "method": "POST",
     "url": "http://absolute.uri/foo",
