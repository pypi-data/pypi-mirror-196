        ### How do I get set up? ###
        
        PyMINEr is now pip installable:
        `python3 -m pip pmd`
        Note that there was another package called pyminer for mining bit-coin - this is definitely not that, so be sure to install bio-pyminer instead!
        
        You can also install using the setup.py script in the distribution like so:
        `python3 setup.py install`
        
        
        ### How do I run PyMINEr? ###
