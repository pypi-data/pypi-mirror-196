        Known Limitations in DbtAlchemy  adapter for GBase 8s databases
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        1) Non-standard SQL queries are not supported. e.g. "SELECT ? FROM TAB1"
        2) For updations involving primary/foreign key references, the entries should be made in correct order. Integrity check is always on and thus the primary keys referenced by the foreign keys in the referencing tables should always exist in the parent table.
        3) Unique key which contains nullable column not supported
        4) UPDATE CASCADE for foreign keys not supported
        5) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY deferred not supported
        6) Subquery in ON clause of LEFT OUTER JOIN not supported
