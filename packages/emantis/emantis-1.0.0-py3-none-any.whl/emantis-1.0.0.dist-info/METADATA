Description
-----------

e-MANTIS is an emulator for the study of large-scale structure formation in the context
of alternative dark energy and gravity theories.
It uses Gaussian Processes to perform a fast and accurate interpolation between the outputs of
high resolution cosmological N-body simulations.
Currently, e-MANTIS is able to give predictions for the following quantities:
   
* Matter power spectrum boost in :math:`f(R)` gravity (described in <cite paper>).

Please cite the corresponding papers if you use e-MANTIS in your work.

More observables and cosmological models will be added in the future. Stay tuned!

Installation
------------

You can directly clone the emulator from our public `repository <https://gitlab.obspm.fr/e-mantis/e-mantis>`_::

   git clone https://gitlab.obspm.fr/e-mantis/e-mantis.git

The emulator needs the following python packages to be installed in order to work:

#. NumPy
#. scikit-learn
#. h5py
