class Contract:
    """
    #### Contracts are agreements between two or more parties that create enforceable obligations. They can take many different forms, from simple agreements to complex legal documents. Some key features of contracts include consideration (i.e., something of value exchanged between the parties), obligations (i.e., the promises made by each party), and enforceability (i.e., the ability to take legal action if a party breaches the contract).

    Args:
        parties: the parties involved in the contract
        consideration: the value exchanged between the parties
        obligations: the promises made by each party

    Methods:
        default(): function to handle a default in a contract
        renew(): function to renew a contract
