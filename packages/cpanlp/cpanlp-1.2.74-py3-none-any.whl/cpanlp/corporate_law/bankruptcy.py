class Bankruptcy:
    """
    #### A class representing a bankruptcy object that checks whether a company or individual is bankrupt.
    - Debt default: Bankruptcy is often caused by the inability to repay debts. Companies or individuals may be forced into bankruptcy proceedings if they fail to pay their debts, interest or principal on time.

    - Asset-liability imbalance: The imbalance of the balance sheet may also lead to bankruptcy. If a company's debts exceed its asset value, it will be unable to repay its debts.

    - Operating losses: Sustained operating losses can also lead to bankruptcy. Companies cannot generate enough revenue to pay their debts and maintain daily operations.

    - Legal litigation: Legal litigation faced by companies or individuals may also lead to bankruptcy. Inability to afford legal fees and compensation may cause a company or individual to go bankrupt.
    Args:
        debt (float): The amount of debt owed by the company or individual.
        assets (float): The value of assets owned by the company or individual.
        revenue (float): The revenue generated by the company or individual.
        expenses (float): The expenses incurred by the company or individual.
        legal_problems (bool): Whether the company or individual is facing legal litigation.

    Attributes:
        is_bankrupt (bool): Whether the company or individual is bankrupt.
