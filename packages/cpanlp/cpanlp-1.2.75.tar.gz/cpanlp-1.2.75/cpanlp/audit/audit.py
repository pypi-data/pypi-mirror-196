class Audit:
    """
    #### Audit is a systematic and independent examination of financial statements, records, and other financial information to provide an opinion on their fairness and accuracy. The objective of an audit is to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

    Features:
        - Independence: An auditor must be independent of the company being audited. This ensures that the auditor is 
          unbiased and can provide an objective opinion on the financial statements.
        - Compliance with standards: The audit must be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
          standards (GAAS) or other applicable auditing standards.
        - Planning: The audit process involves careful planning, including identifying risks and determining the 
          scope of the audit.
        - Evidence gathering: The auditor must obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to support the opinion 
          provided in the audit report.
        - Evaluation of internal controls: The auditor must evaluate the company's internal controls to determine 
          their effectiveness in preventing and detecting material misstatements.
        - Communication: The auditor must communicate with management and those charged with governance throughout 
          the audit process to ensure that any issues or concerns are addressed.

    Args:
        financial_statements (list): A list of financial statements to be audited.
        auditor (str): The name of the auditor performing the audit.
