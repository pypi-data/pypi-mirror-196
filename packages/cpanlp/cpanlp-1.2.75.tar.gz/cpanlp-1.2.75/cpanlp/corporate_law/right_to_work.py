class RightToWork:
    """
    A class to represent right-to-work (RTW) laws, which allow employees to choose whether or not to join a union and whether or not to pay union dues.
    
    Features
    ----------
    - Voluntary union membership: RTW laws allow employees to choose whether or not to join a union, and whether or not to pay union dues.
    - Protection of individual rights: RTW laws protect the individual rights of employees by allowing them to make their own decisions regarding union membership and dues.
    - Economic impact: RTW laws can have a significant impact on a state's economy, as they can affect the strength and influence of unions in the state.
    - Controversial: RTW laws are controversial, with proponents arguing that they promote individual freedom and economic growth, while opponents argue that they weaken unions and harm workers.
