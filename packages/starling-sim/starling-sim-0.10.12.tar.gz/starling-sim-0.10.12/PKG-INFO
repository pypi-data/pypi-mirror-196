**Starling** is an agent-based framework for mobility simulation implemented in Python. 
The framework provides users with tools to quickly develop agent-based simulators of a specific transport service.
Among these tools, there is a number of generic transport classes that can be used in several transport contexts,
accessible input and output formats (JSON, GeoJSON) with JSON schema specifications, visualisation and KPI outputs, etc.

**Starling** also comes with three simulation models :

 - A free-floating vehicle-sharing service
 - A station-based vehicle-sharing service
 - A station-based vehicle-sharing service with repositioning

**For now, Starling is not adapted to be used as a package : users should rather clone the project 
locally to develop and run new simulations.**
