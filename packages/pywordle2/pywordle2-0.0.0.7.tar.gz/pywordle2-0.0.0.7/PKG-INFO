# PyWordle

![build status](https://github.com/agale123/py-wordle/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)

Game Engine for the popular Wordle game.

## Installing the package

To install the package, run

```
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

This package provides two classes: `Wordle` and `Game`. The `Wordle` class
allows you to provide a set of possible solutions from which a game can be
created. The `Game` class represents a single game with a specific solution.
You are allowed six guesses to solve the game. Here is a quick example of
how you might interact with the game:

```py
wordle = Wordle(WORD_LIST)
game = wordle.create_game()
game.guess("SPILL")
print(str(game))
```

## Interactive example

An interactive example is provided to demonstrate how this library can be used
to run a text based version of the classic Wordle game. The following command
will run this example:

```
python examples/interactive.py
```
