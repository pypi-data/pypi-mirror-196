## Introduction👋

+ what is GPG?

GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is a free and open-source tool for encrypting and signing data and communications. It uses public-key cryptography to ensure the security and privacy of your data. With GPG, you can encrypt your files and messages so that only the intended recipient can read them, and you can also digitally sign your messages to prove their authenticity.

+ what is easyGPG

easyGPG is a tool that allows you to work with GPG easily instead of using the original library. With two different versions available, you can choose the one that best fits your needs.
This GUI version helps you to get rid of typing codes and other stuff. So you can easily do whatever just with forms. 🎉

## Features💡
