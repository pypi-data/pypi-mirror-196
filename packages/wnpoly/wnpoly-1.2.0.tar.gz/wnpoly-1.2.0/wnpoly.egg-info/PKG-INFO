Overview
========

The module computes various polynomials useful for `webnucleo <https://webnucleo.readthedocs.io>`_ projects.  In particular, the package has modules to compute symmetric and Bell polynomials for input sets of variables.  For the complete Bell polynomials, the package also has a routine to invert an appropriate set of Bell polynomials to find the variables that would give rise to those polynomials.

Installation
------------

Install from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/wnpoly>`_ with pip by
typing in your favorite terminal::

    $ pip install wnpoly
