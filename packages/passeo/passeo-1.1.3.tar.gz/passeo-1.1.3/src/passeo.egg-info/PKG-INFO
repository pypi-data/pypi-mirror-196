"🔓 Generate a Password with multiple options"

# What is Passeo?

Passeo is a python password generator developed by [Arjun Sharda](https://github.com/ArjunSharda), under the [MIT License](https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Passeo/blob/main/LICENSE).

<br>
Passeo is used for checking your password through our strength check (includes Pwned, Length, and Case) and generate a password with multiple options.
</br>

# Why use Passeo?

Passeo is a upcoming password generator project, with massive plans in the future, such as generation of a password and strength checker via CLI/terminal. Passeo is also completely safe to use and is open source for the community to know how the codebase works and learn from how the password generator.


-----------------

# Quickstart

```python
from passeo import passeo
print(passeo.generate(length=10, numbers=True, symbols=True, uppercase=True, lowercase=False, space=True, save=True))
```

# v1.1.0 changes
----------------
- **[BREAKING]** Changed Passeo to a Enum, meaning that it will now be for generation for example `passeo.generate`, not `passeo().generate`.
- **[ADDED]** Added encrypting and decrypting. It has been supported by CLI.

# v1.1.3 changes
----------------
- **[FIXED]** Fixed CLI and normal issues with encrypting and decrypting (wrong function from Fernet was used)
