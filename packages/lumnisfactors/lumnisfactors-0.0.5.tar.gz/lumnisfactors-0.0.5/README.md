# Lumnis Crypto Alternative Data API

The LUMNIS Crypto API provides the most comprehensive factor dataset for crypto assets. We provide the following group of factors:

- **Micro-structural Factors** - These are factors derived from **order book data and trade data**. We process terabytes of data to extract the most relevant order book and trade factors that are delivered in real-time
- **Regime Factors** - We provide **regime data** that enables users to observe how strategies perform in different conditions of the market. For example, some strategies work better during high volatile regimes. We use proprietary algorithms for effectively determining regimes.


This data can be used for backtesting and implementing trading strategies.
