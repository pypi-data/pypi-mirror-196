# pyqt-openai

Example of using OpenAI with PyQt (Python cross-platform GUI toolkit)



This shows an example of using OpenAI with PyQt as a chatbot. 



The OpenAI model this package uses is the <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3">text-davinci-003</a> model of GPT-3 by default.



Image generation feature available since v0.0.16. You can see the detail in <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/introduction">official OpenAI</a> site. Currently this feature is very basic now.



You can select other model with the combobox on the sidebar at the right side of the window.



An internet connection is required. 



## Requirements

* PyQt5

* aiohttp - It needs to be installed for the current version of OpenAI.

* openai



## Preview

## How to play

1. git clone ~

2. from the root directory, type "cd pyqt_openai"

3. You should put your api key in the line edit. You can get it in <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys">official site</a> of openai. Sign up and log in before you get it.



Be sure, this is a very important API key that belongs to you only, so you should remember it and keep it secure.

4. python main.py



If installation doesn't work, check the troubleshooting below.



## Troubleshooting

If you see this error while installing the openai package

```

subprocess-exited-with-error

```

you can shout a curse word and just download the package itself from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/openai/#files">pypi</a>. 



Unzip it, access the package directory, type 

```

python setup.py install

```



That will install the openai.



## TODO list

* <s>logging</s>

* fine-tuning (with JSONL) - currently working

* Add the fine-tuned model in combo box

* Sync the fine-tunes, analysis (with wanDB)

* show the explanation of every model and terms related to AI (e.g. temperature, topp..)

* <s>Basic style</s>

* highlight the source

* Add the basic example sources of making deep learning model with PyTorch
