# visualscript
Work in progress.

This module's goal is to allow you to create simple python programs 
as graphs of nodes representing functions, variables and statements.

As a main reference it uses visual language of Unreal Engine's 
blueprints graphs, which serve as an amazing tool for quick prototyping, 
especially for people less experienced in programming.
