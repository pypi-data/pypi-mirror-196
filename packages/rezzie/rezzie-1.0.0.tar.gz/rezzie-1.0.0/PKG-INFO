`rezzie`: A small library for accessing resources and data shipped with your 
package without using the pkg_resources API.

## Background

Shipping data files with your Bioinformatic Python packages is a typical pattern. There are several ways of accessing these data files, but they can be cumbersome and error-prone. One common approach often recommended on StackOverflow is to use the module's `__file__` attribute to find the path of the running script and, from there, find the relative path to the resource. But, this approach is fragile and can easily break if the resource is moved, and it doesn't deal with the case where the resource is in a zip file. Another approach is to use the `pkg_resources` API. But, that module is substantial and has a lot of dependencies, which can cause significant startup times for your command-line tools.

A third-party package called `importlib_resources` provides a nice API to deal with this problem, and in more recent versions of (Python ≥3.9), it has become part of the standard library and is built on the `importlib.resource` API of the standard library.

Here, we provide a simple library that has a single function to access the path to any resource shipped with your package. The function returns a `pathlib.Path` object. You can then read the contents of the file, pass it to a subprocess routine, or do anything else you may need or want  to do.
We have made it so that it transparently supports versions of Python ≥3.7. When using versions of Python ≥3.9, it uses the standard library `importlib_resources` API. Otherwise, it uses the `importlib_resources` package. It will only install the `importlib_resources` package if the Python version requires it. So, it should keep things lean if you use a recent Python version.

For that reason and many more, we recommend using Python ≥3.10. There are significant performance improvements in the standard library importlib API and notable performances in Python overall to warrant the upgrade.
## Installation

You can install `rezzie` from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
    pip install rezzie
```

## Usage

To use `rezzie`, you need to have a package that has resources that you want to
access. For example, let's say you have a package called `my_package` that has
a resource called `my_resource.txt` in a folder called `data`, that you want to 
access. You can do that using the `rezzie` API as follows:

```python
    from rezzie import get_path

    resource_path = get_path("my_package", "data", "my_resource.txt")
```

The `get_path` function takes two arguments: the name of the package, and the
path and name of the resource.

## Example

Let's say you have a package called `my_package` that has a resource called
`my_resource.txt` in a folder called `data`, that you want to access.

The `my_package` package has the following structure:

```bash
    my_package
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── data
    │   └── my_resource.txt
    └── __main__.py
```

Your `pyproject.toml` file should look like this to ensure the data files are 
packaged correctly (this assumes using `setuptools` as the build backend):

```toml
    [build-system]
    requires = ["setuptools>=42", "wheel"]
    build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

    [project]
    name = "my_package"
    
    [tool.setuptools]
    include-package-data = true

    [tool.setuptools.package-data]
    my_package = ["*.txt"]
```

The `my_package/__init__.py` file should look like this:

```python
    from rezzie import get_path

    resource_path = get_path("my_package", "data", "my_resource.txt")
```
