            You can use a lambda function (in string) to generate
            the sample name from the stem of input file
        ref: The reference fasta file, used to grab the reference allele.
            To add contigs in header, the `fai` file is also required at
            `<ref>.fai`
        genome: The genome assembly, added as `source` in header
        base: 0 or 1, whether the coordinates in BED file are 0- or 1-based
        headers: The header lines to be added to the VCF file
        infos: The INFO dicts to be added to the VCF file
        formats: The FORMAT dicts to be added to the VCF file
            The keys 'ID', 'Description', 'Type', and 'Number' are required.
        converters: A dict of converters to be used for each INFO or FORMAT
            The key is the ID of an INFO or FORMAT, and the value is
            Any converts return `None` will skip the record
        nonexisting_contigs: Whether to `keep` or `drop` the non-existing
            contigs in `ref`.
        helpers: Raw code to be executed to provide some helper functions
            since only lambda functions are supported in converters

        cutoff: The cutoff to determine the ends of consensus regions

        distance: When the distance between two bins is smaller than this value,
            they are merged into one bin using `bedtools merge -d`. `0` means
            no merging.
