        ================
        
        <!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->
        
        Recently my lab, the Rijkserfgoedlaboratorium in Amsterdam, acquired a
        new Bruker Crono X-Ray Fluorescence spectral image (MACRO-XRF) scanner.
        This instrument saves its raw data into a specific type of HDF5 file
        format. Currently these files can only be read and converted by
        commercially licensed Crono software. This situation restricts access to
        the data to a limited number of researchers who can run the software.
        Furthermore, it is likely that we will loose the ability to read the
        data at some point in the future.
        
        In order to make optimal use of the Crono data in collaborative research
        projects now and to make sure that we can still read the data in the
        future we need to: 1) understand the Crono HDF5 file format, and 2)
        develop open software tools available to all researchers for reading and
        converting these data files. To support open heritage science
        `cronomaxrf` package is currently being developed under the GPLv3 open
        source software license.
