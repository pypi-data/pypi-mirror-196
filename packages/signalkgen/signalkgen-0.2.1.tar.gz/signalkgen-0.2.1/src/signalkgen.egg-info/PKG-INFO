Generate Test Data for Navactor
==============

A test data generator for [Signal K](https://signalk.org/specification/1.7.0/doc/data_model.html) json forming time-series graphs of
marine reporters reporting their own info as well as that of their nearest
neighbors'.


see: https://signalk.org/specification/1.7.0/doc/data_model.html

Test output is validated against the Signal K scheme with the [Signal K project's validation tool](https://github.com/SignalK/specification).

also, long live PEP 621

Status

* Generates arrays of boats moving in different directions at different speeds.

* Currently boats reporting other boats is random and the nearest neighbor
