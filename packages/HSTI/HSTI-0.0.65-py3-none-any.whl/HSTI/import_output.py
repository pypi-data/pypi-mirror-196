#This function imports the output file into one large 2D array. The first three columns (column [0:2] - both included) present the voltage supplied to each of the three piezos. 
#Column [3:5] contain the measured intensities by the three photo diodes. Column 6 contain the sensor temperature multiplied by 100. Column [7:9] contain integers which are 
#used to calculate the actual temperature of the sensor. The final three columns (if present) display the GSK voltage, the GFID voltage and Gain respectively. 
#Only the first 6 columns are recorded during initial learnings and all other values are represented by np.nan.
