    """
    A replacement for Python's sched.scheduler object,
    adding full threading support and a modern Python interface.

    Python's sched.scheduler object is unfixable; its interface
    means it cannot correctly handle some scenarios:
        * If one thread has called sched.scheduler.run,
          and the next scheduled event will occur at time T,
          and a second thread schedules a new event which
          occurs at a time < T, sched.scheduler.run won't
          return any events to the first thread until time T.
        * If one thread has called sched.scheduler.run,
          and the next scheduled event will occur at time T,
          and a second thread cancels all events,
          sched.scheduler.run won't exit until time T.

    Also, sched.scheduler is thirty years behind the times in
    Python API design.  Its events are callbacks, which it
    calls.  Scheduler fixes this: its events are objects,
    and you iterate over the Scheduler object to receive
    events as they become due.

    Scheduler also benefits from thirty years of improvements
    to sched.scheduler, and in particular reimplements the
    entire (relevant portion of the) sched.scheduler test suite.
