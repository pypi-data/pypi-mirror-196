What is this?
--------------

This is a module created basically for test and learning purposes.

    print_lol function takes a positional argument called 'the_list', which is any python list
    (of, possibly nested lists). Each data item in the provided list is recursively printed
    to the screen on its own line. (or into a file)
    
    ---Arguments----------(default value)
    1st - 'the_list'
    2nd - 'indent' is used to activate the indentation. (False)
    3rd - 'level' is used to insert tab-stops when a nested list is encontered. (0)
    4th - 'print_in' gives us the ability to print the output in separated files or screen. (sys.stdout)
