The main functionalities of this repository cover creating and parsing Smali files with Python3 as well as decrypt Google's hidden JAR file in the offical `play-services-ads` module.

For more information about the hidden JAR files, visit the [API-Docs](https://rgoogle.readthedocs.io/) - there you will find detailed explanation about the topic.

## Installation

By now, the only way to install the python module in this repository is by cloning it and running the following command:

```bash
$ cd ./rgoogle && pip install .
```

## Usage

For a more detailed explanation of the Smali Visitor-API use the [docs](https://rgoogle.readthedocs.io/).

### Parsing Smali-Files

The simplest way to parse code is to use a `SmaliReader` together with a visitor:

```python
from rgoogle.smali import SmaliReader, ClassVisitor

code = """
.class public final Lcom/example/Hello;
.super Ljava/lang/Object;
# One line comment
.source "SourceFile" # EOL comment
"""

reader = SmaliReader()
reader.visit(code, ClassVisitor())
```

There are a few options to have in mind when parsing with a `SmaliReader`:

* `comments`: To explicitly parse comments, set this variable to True (in constructor or directly)
* `snippet`: To parse simple code snippets without a .class definition, use the 'snippet' variable (or within the constructor). Use this property only if you don't have a '.class' definition at the start of the source code
* `validate`: Validates the parsed code
* `errors`: With values `"strict"` or `"ignore"` this attribute will cause the reader to raise or ignore exceptions

Actually, the code above does nothing as the `ClassVisitor` class does not handle any notification by the reader. For instance, to print out the class name of a parsed code, the following implementation could be used:

```python
from rgoogle.smali import SmaliReader, ClassVisitor, Type

class NamePrinterVisitor(ClassVisitor):
    def visit_class(self, name: str, access_flags: int) -> None:
        # The provided name is the type descriptor, so we have to 
        # convert it:
        cls_type = Type(name)
        print('ClassName:', cls_type.class_name)

reader = SmaliReader()
reader.visit(".class public final Lcom/example/Hello;", NamePrinterVisitor())
```

### Writing Smali-Files

Writing is as simple as parsing files. To write the exact same document the has been parsed, the `SmaliWriter` class can be used as the visitor:

```python
from rgoogle.smali import SmaliReader, SmaliWriter

reader = SmaliReader()
writer = SmaliWriter()

reader.visit(".class public final Lcom/example/Hello;", writer)
# The source code can be retrieved via a property
text = writer.code
```

To create own Smali files, the pre-defined `SmaliWriter` can be used again:

```python
from rgoogle.smali import SmaliWriter, AccessType

writer = SmaliWriter()
# create the class definition
writer.visit_class("Lcom/example/Hello;", AccessType.PUBLIC + AccessType.FINAL)
writer.visit_super("Ljava/lang/Object;")

# create a field
field_writer = writer.visit_field("foo", AccessType.PRIVATE, "Ljava/lang/String")

# create the finished source code, BUT don't forget visit_end()
writer.visit_end()
text = writer.code
```
