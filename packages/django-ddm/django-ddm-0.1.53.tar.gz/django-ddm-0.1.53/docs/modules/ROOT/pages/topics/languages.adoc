## Translation

The administration interface for researchers currently only supports English.
The participation interface currently supports English and German.


### Language Detection

The language in which the interface for participants is displayed is determined
by the default language of the participant's browser.
If a language is not implemented for the participant interface, it is displayed
in English.


### Adding Support for new Languages

To add support for a new language, new locales must be added at two locations:

1. In the Django code: `/ddm/locale/` +
A description of how to do this can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/i18n/translation/#localization-how-to-create-language-files

2. In the code of the VUE component: `/frontend/src/translations/` +
Here, support for a new language can be added by appending the respective locale name
as a first-level key to the json files and adding corresponding translations for all translation blocks.
