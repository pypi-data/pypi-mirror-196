Description: # alienHtml
        - A Python package to help with HTML development.
        
        ## Features
        - Creates a HTML file in a specified directory.
        - Helps you edit it through functions and parameters.
        - Allows you to open the HTML file in your browser with one simple function.
        - You can edit an already existing file, or create a new one.
        - Indentation!
        
        ## Example:
        ```python
        from alienHTML import *
        
        # "w" is the mode to open, in this case write. 
        mypage = WebPage("/path/to/file/to/create/or/edit", "w", tabhead="Hello World", bgcolour="powderblue",icon="path/to/icon.ico")
        # If you put it as "a" it switches to edit mode
        # For tabhead, bgcolour and icon, if not set it will automatically set itself to some defaults.
        
        # This creates a heading of the largest size as the number is one.
        # It will ask you where you want it in the <body> section of your code
        mypage.Heading("Hello World",1)
        # Similar for images, just with different parameters. The second is the alt text.
        mypage.Image("/path/to/image.png", "Image!")
        
        mypage.showfile() # Prints the contents of the file with line numbers and indentation.
        mypage.openpage() # Opens the HTML file in web browser.						             
        ```
        Outputs:
        
        - Ask you where to put code for heading and image.
        - Prints the file in shell.
        - Opens the page in a web browser
        
        ## To do:
        
        - Add more web page features.
        - Make the showfile function open the HTML file in web browser, so there is syntax highlighting.
