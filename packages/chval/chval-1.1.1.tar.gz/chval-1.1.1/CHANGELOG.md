  -- Louis Paternault <spalax@gresille.org>

* gams 0.6.0 (2011-02-06)

  This new version changes the way passwords are stored. It is necessary to run tool gams5to6.py (in directory "meta") to convert password file from old format to old format. Syntax is:

      gams5to6.py [gamsrc]

  Now, the actual changelog:

  * Using different methods to encrypt and decrypt strings: solves the following bugs.
    * Closes bug: long passwords are now allowed;
    * Closes bug: brackets are no longer ignored at the end of passwords.
  * Improved behaviour when Ctrl-C is hit.
  * The same password is now encrypted in a different string for different getmailrc files (there is no way to tell that two getmailrc files have the same password because their hash are the same).
  * Closes bug: Using strong random function.
  * Closes bug: Options --gamsdir and --version can now be used after command.
  * Closes bug: A daemon that was not answering to ping made client crash.
  * Closes bug in "gams fill": Password was asked for getmailrc files that already contained passwords.
  * Closes bug: Ignore getmailrc files without passwords with "gams getmail"
  * Closes bug: Daemon now asks password only if it needs it
  * Minor code refactoring and improvement.
