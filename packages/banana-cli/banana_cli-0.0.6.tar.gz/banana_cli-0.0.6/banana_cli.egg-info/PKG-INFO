Description: # banana-cli
        v0; work in progress; not stable release
        
        The goal of the Banana CLI is to bring an npm-like experience to ML development loops. 
        This version includes:
        - `banana init` to create a project with boilerplate
        - `banana dev` to run a dev server with hot-reload when app.py changes
        
        ---
        
        ## To use it
        
        1. Install the CLI with pip
        ```bash
        pip3 install banana-cli==0.0.6
        ```
        
        2. Create a new project directory with 
        ```bash
        banana init my-app
        cd my-app
        ```
        3. Start the hot reloading dev server
        ```bash
        banana dev
        ```
        The dev server expects you to already have jupyter notebook installed, runnable with `jupyter notebook`
        
        ## Hot-Reload Dev Server
        
        The interactive dev server works like a react, next, or nodemon server: it selectively hot reloads components when you save changes to different parts of your `app.py` file.
        
        The init() function is ran on startup and for every change to init().
        
        The handler() function is ran on every change to handler(), without needing to wait for a long init()
        
        It does this by pushing code in logical chunks to a jupyter notebook backend, to persist memory between reloads.
        
        ## Play with it:
        
        6. Try changing the handler, see what happens!
        7. Try changing the init, see what happens!
