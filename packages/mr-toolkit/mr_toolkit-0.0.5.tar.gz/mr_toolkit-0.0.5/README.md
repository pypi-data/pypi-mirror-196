Tools for reweighting Markov models.

### Todo

- [ ] Remove `deeptime` dependency for kmeans -- replace with `sklearn`
- [x] Remove `msm_we` dependency for connected sets -- really heavy
- [ ] Replace `pyemma` dependencies with `deeptime` (probably want to write some tests first)
- [x] Sample NESS splicing + estimation notebook
- [x] Sample reweighting notebook
- [x] Sample Sigopt hyperparameter optimization notebook
