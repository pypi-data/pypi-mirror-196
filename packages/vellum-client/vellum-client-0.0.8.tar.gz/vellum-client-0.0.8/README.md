# Vellum Python Library

The Vellum python library provides convenient access to the Vellum Predict API from python applications.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install vellum-client
```

## Usage

### Setup
You'll need an API key from your Vellum account to use this library. You can create an API key from within your account [here](https://app.vellum.ai/api-keys). 
We recommend setting it as an environment variable.

### Generating Text
Here's an example of initializing the library with the API key
loaded from an environment variable and initiating a generation:

```python
import vellum

vellum.api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

result = vellum.Generate.run(
    deployment_name="my-deployment",
    requests=[
        vellum.GenerateRequest(
            input_values={"question": "Can I get a refund?"}
        )
    ]
)

print(result.text)
```

### Submitting Actuals
Submitting actuals is how you provide feedback to Vellum about the quality of the generated text.
This feedback can be used to measure model quality and improve it over time.

```python
import vellum

vellum.SubmitCompletionActuals.run(
    deployment_name="customer-service-demo",
    actuals=[
        vellum.CompletionActual(
            id="<id-returned-from-generate-endpoint>",
            quality=1.0,  # 1.0 is good, 0.0 is bad
            text="Sorry, we do not offer refunds.",
        )
    ]
)
```

**Note:** If you don't want to keep track of the ids that Vellum generates, you can include an externalId key in
the initial generate request. You can then include this externalId when submitting actuals. If you use this
approach, be sure that the ids you provide truly are unique, or you may get unexpected results.


### Performing a Search
Vellum's Search allows you to upload documents and then perform semantic searches against them.
Here is an example of how to perform a search:

```python
import vellum

vellum.api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

result = vellum.Search.run(
    index_name="help-center-docs",
    query="What is fine tuning?",
    options=vellum.SearchOptions(limit=3),
)

print(result)
```
