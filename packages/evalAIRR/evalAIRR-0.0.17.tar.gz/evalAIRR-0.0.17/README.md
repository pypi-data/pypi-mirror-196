# evalAIRR

A tool that allows comparison of real and simulated datasets by providing different statistical indicators and dataset visualizations in one report.

## Installation

It is recommended to use a virtual python environment to run evalAIRR if another python environment is used. Here is a quick guide on how you can set up a virtual environment:

`https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments`

### Install using pip

Run this command to install the evalAIRR package:

`pip install evalairr`

## Quickstart

evalAIRR uses a YAML file for configuration. If you are unfamiliar with how YAML files are structured, read this guide to the syntax:

`https://docs.fileformat.com/programming/yaml/#syntax`

This is the stucture of a sample report configuration file you can use to start off with (it is included in the repository location ./yaml_files/quickstart.yaml):

```
datasets:
  real:
    path: ./data/encoded_real_1000_200.csv
  sim:
    path: ./data/encoded_sim_1000_200.csv
reports:
  feature_based:
    report1:
      features:
        - TGT
        - ANV
      report_types:
        - ks
        - distr_densityplot
output:
  path: ./output/report.html
```

This report will process the two provided datasets (real and simulated) with encoded kmer data, and create an HTML report with feature-based report types - Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (indicated by `ks`) and a feature distribution density plot (indicated by `distr_densityplot`) for the features `TGT` and `ANV`. It will then export the report to the path `./output/report.html`. More details on what reports can be created can be found in the _YAML Configuration Guidelines_ section.

The repository contains sample datafiles and a quickstart YAML configuration files. You can clone the repository and run evalAIRR within it to use sample data.

Within the cloned repository run the command:

`evalairr -i ./yaml_files/quickstart.yaml`

The report will be generated in the specified output path in the configuration file or, if a specific path is not provided, in `<CURRENT_DIRECTORY>/output/report.html`. The report is exported in the HTML format.

## YAML Configuration Guidelines

The configuration YAML file consists of 3 main sections: `datasets`, `reports` and `output`.

### Datasets

In the `datasets` section, you have to provide paths to a real and a simulated datasets that you are comparing. CSV files with encoded kmer data are supported. This can be done by specifying the file path of each file in the `path` variable under the sections `real` and `sim` respectively. Here is an example of how a configured `datasets` section looks like:

```
datasets:
  real:
    path: ./data/encoded_real_1000_200.csv
  sim:
    path: ./data/encoded_sim_1000_200.csv
```

### Reports

In the `reports` section, you can provide the list of report types you want to create and their parameters. There are three types of report groups depending on the different parameters: `feature_based`, `observation_based` and `generic`. Here is the list of reports you can create that compare the features of the real dataset with the simulated dataset:

#### Feature-based reports

- <b>`ks`</b> - Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic. Parameters: list of features you are creating the report for.
- <b>`distr_histogram`</b> - feature distribution histogram. Parameters: list of features you are creating the report for.
- <b>`distr_boxplot`</b> - feature distribution boxplot. Parameters: list of features you are creating the report for.
- <b>`distr_violinplot`</b> - feature distribution violin plot. Parameters: list of features you are creating the report for.
- <b>`distr_densityplot`</b> - feature distribution density plot. Parameters: list of features you are creating the report for.
- <b>`distance`</b> - Euclidean distance between the real and simulated feature. Parameters: list of features you are creating the report for.
- <b>`statistics`</b> - statistical indicators (average, median, standard deviation and variance) of a feature in both real and simulated datasets. Parameters: list of features you are creating the report for.

#### Observation-based reports

- <b>`observation_distr_histogram`</b> - observation distribution histogram. Parameters: list of observations you are creating the report for.
- <b>`observation_distr_boxplot`</b> - observation distribution boxplot. Parameters: list of observations you are creating the report for.
- <b>`observation_distr_violinplot`</b> - observation distribution violin plot. Parameters: list of observations you are creating the report for.
- <b>`observation_distr_densityplot`</b> - observation distribution density plot. Parameters: list of observations you are creating the report for. The observation index `all` can be used to report on all observations in one plot.
- <b>`observation_distance`</b> - Euclidean distance between the real and simulated observation. Parameters: list of observations you are creating the report for.
- <b>`observation_statistics`</b> - statistical indicators (average, median, standard deviation and variance) of an observation in both real and simulated datasets. Parameters: list of observations you are creating the report for.

Additional parameters: `with_ml_sim` - optional parameter, which if True, instructs the report to include a comparison with a generated dataset using a GaussianProcessRegressor machine learning model trained on the real dataset (currently, only applies to the report type `observation_distr_densityplot` in reports with `all` observations). `ml_random_state` - optional integer parameter, relevant only if `with_ml_sim` is set to True, which sets a seed in the machine learning model random number generation.

#### General reports

- <b>`ks`</b> - Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic for all features. Parameters: `output` - optional parameter, that specifies the path of text/csv file the results will be exported to (default value is set to `./output/ks.csv`).
- <b>`copula_2d`</b> - a 2D scatter plot that displays two features in a Gausian Multivariate copula space. Parameters: a report section of any name, under which the compared features are specified.
- <b>`copula_3d`</b> - a 3D scatter plot that displays three features in a Gausian Multivariate copula space. Parameters: a report section of any name, under which the compared features are specified.
- <b>`feature_average_vs_variance`</b> - a scatter plot that displays the average value of every feature on one axis and the variance of every feature on the other axis. Parameters: `with_ml_sim` - optional parameter, which if True, instructs the report to include a comparison with a generated dataset using a GaussianProcessRegressor machine learning model trained on the real dataset. `ml_random_state` - optional integer parameter, relevant only if `with_ml_sim` is set to True, which sets a seed in the machine learning model random number generation.

- <b>`distance`</b> - Euclidean distance between the real and simulated features. Parameters: `output` - optional parameter, that specifies the path of text/csv file the results will be exported to (default value is set to `./output/dist.csv`).
- <b>`statistics`</b> - statistical indicators (average, median, standard deviation and variance) of all features in both real and simulated datasets. Parameters: `output_dir` - optional parameter, that specifies the directory for the csv files in which the csv result files `real_stat.csv` and `sim_stat.csv` will be exported to (default value is set to `./output/`). Each csv file contain four rows, each with a different statistic: 1 - average, 2 - median, 3 - standard deviation, 4 - variance.

### Output

An optional section where you can specify the file path of the generated report. The default path of the generated report is `<CURRENT_DIRECTORY>/output/report.html`. The report is exported in the HTML format. If you declare the path as 'NONE', the report will not be created.

An example output section:

```
output:
  path: ./output/report.html
```

For example, this output section would result in a report file not being created:

```
output:
  path: NONE
```
