This library was initially built to faciliate automated data ingest for wildfire modeling and analysis internally at [FireSci]. However, we\'re happy to open-source and maintain this tool to enable broader user of LANDFIRE data across the wildfire community!\n\n### Supported LANDFIRE functionality\n\n- Clipping requested data to a specific bounding box\n- Reprojection of output data coordinate system to user-specified well-known integer ID format\n- Specifying a list of data product layers and obtaining a multi-band .tif output\n- Modifying the resampling resolution\n\n### Additional functionality\n\n- Search functionality to allow users to search for products by LANDFIRE version, name, product theme, product code, or availability regions (US, AK, HI)\n- Geospatial helpers to obtain suitable bounding box from a GeoJSON polygon or file (GeoJSON, ESRI Shapefile, ESRIJSON, CSV, FlatGeobuf, SQLite)\n- Robust model and enumerations of LANDFIRE products\n- User input validation to reduce potential failed API jobs and server load\n\n### Planned but not currently supported\n\n- Specifying edit rules for fuels data (requires a great deal of user-input validation)\n- Specifying an edit mask for edit rules (requires more LANDFIRE API i/o implementation)\n- Note the LANDFIRE API does not currently provide support for insular regions\n- We will add new products here as they become available\n\n## Requirements\n\n- python >=3.8, <3.12\n- [attrs], [pydantic], and [requests] will be installed when you install the lib\n- Optional dependencies included in the `geospatial` extra are [geojson] and [geopandas]\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install landfire\n```\n\nTo use the geospatial tools found in `geospatial.py`, you\'ll need to install the extra dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install "landfire[geospatial]"\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nPlease see the [documentation] for details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome!
