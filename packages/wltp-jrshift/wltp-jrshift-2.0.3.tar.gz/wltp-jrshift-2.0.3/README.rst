Introduction
============

The aim of the JR-Shift is obtain the Required Engine Speeds, the Available Powers, the Required Vehicle Speeds
and the Gears for the whole WLTC based on the vehicle characteristics. The model should allow accurate calculation
of final trace and the operating conditions of the engine.

Overview
--------
The calculator accepts as input an excel file  that contains the vehicle's technical data, along with parameters for
modifying the execution WLTC cycle, and it then spits-out the gear-shifts of the vehicle and the others parameters used
during the obtaining of these. It does not calculate any |CO2| emissions.

Installation
============
Prerequisites
-------------
**Python-3.6+** is required and **Python-3.7** recommended.
It requires **numpy/scipy** and **pandas** libraries with native backends.

.. Tip::
    On *Windows*, it is preferable to use the `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`__ distribution.
    To avoid possible incompatibilities with other projects

Download
--------
Download the sources,

- either with *git*, by giving this command to the terminal::

      git clone https://github.com/JRCSTU/gearshift_calculation_tool --depth=1

Install
-------
From within the project directory, run one of these commands to install it:

- for standard python, installing with ``pip`` is enough (but might)::

      pip install -e .[path_to_gearshift_calculation_tool_folder]

Quick-Start
===========

Cmd-line usage
--------------
The command-line usage below requires the Python environment to be installed, and provides for
executing an experiment directly from the OS's shell (i.e. ``cmd`` in windows or ``bash`` in POSIX),
and in a *single* command.  To have precise control over the inputs and outputs

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gearshift --help                                                  ## to get generic help for cmd-line syntax
    $ gearshift demo                                                    ## to get demo input file
    $ gearshift run "path_input_file" -O "path_to_save_output_file"     ## to run gearshift tool

Usage
=====

In this example we will use gearshift model in order to predict the gears.

Setup
-----
Import dispatcher(dsp) from gearshift tool that contains functions and simulation model to process vehicle data and Import also
schedula for selecting and executing functions. for more information on how to use `schedula <https://pypi.org/project/schedula/>`__

.. code-block:: python

    from gearshift.core import dsp
    import schedula as sh

Load data
---------
* Load vehicle data for a specific vehicle from `excel template <https://github.com/JRCSTU/gearshift_calculation_tool/raw/main/gearshift/demos/gs_input_demo.xlsx>`__

    .. code-block:: python

        vehData = 'gs_input_demo.xlsx'

* Define the input dictionary for the dispacher.

    .. code-block:: python

        input = dict(input_file_name=vehData)

.. _end-library:

.. _start-dispacher1:

Dispatcher
----------
* Dispatcher will select and execute the proper functions for the given inputs and the requested outputs

  .. code-block:: python

    core = dsp(input, outputs=['sol'], shrink=True)

.. _end-dispacher1:

* Plot workflow of the core model from the dispatcher

  .. code-block:: python

      core.plot()

  This will automatically open an internet browser and show the work flow of the core model as below.
  You can click all the rectangular boxes to see in detail sub models like load, model, write and plot.

.. _start-dispacher2:

* Load outputs of dispatcher Select the chosen dictionary key (sol) from the given dictionary.

    .. code-block:: python

        solution = sh.selector(['sol'], sh.selector(['sol'], core))

* Select each output case

    .. code-block:: python

        # Select first case
        solution['sol'][0]

        # Select second case case
        solution['sol'][1]

        # Select gears output for different cases
        gears = {}
        for sol in solution['sol']:
            gears[f'gears_{sol["Case"]}'] = sol['GearsOutput']
