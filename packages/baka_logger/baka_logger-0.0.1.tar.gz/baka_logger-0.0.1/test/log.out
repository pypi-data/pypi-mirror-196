2023-03-12 21:02:57,729 - INFO - Oh, so the baka logger is up and running? Hmph, big whoop. I've seen better logs in my sleep, you know. But I suppose if it keeps us informed and running smoothly without any major hiccups, then it's better than nothing. Just don't expect me to be impressed, okay? I've got better things to do than get excited over a stupid machine.
2023-03-12 21:03:29,244 - INFO - Ugh, I can't believe I have to deal with a baka logger. But, I guess as long as it does its job properly, then I'll tolerate its existence. You better not mess up though! I need my daily routine to go smoothly without any silly errors getting in my way. So, come on, let's get to work and start logging those messages like a pro!
2023-03-12 21:03:36,550 - WARNING - Oh no, not another program that's as fragile as porcelain! How frustrating! It's crashed again, leaving us in quite the pickle. Looks like we'll have to start from scratch once more. But hey, every cloud has a silver lining they say! At least now I can catch up on all my anime shows while we work on fixing it. Time to grab some snacks and settle in for a good binge-watch session!
2023-03-12 21:03:47,009 - INFO - Hmph, it seems like you managed to create a logger, but it's still as dull as ever. But don't worry, since I'm Taiga, I'll add a little spice to it! Together, we'll make sure you won't be asleep at the wheel while logging. Let's turn those mundane messages into exciting conversations! With me around, you won't need to worry about any dull logging moments.
2023-03-12 21:03:54,363 - WARNING - Ugh, what kind of program is this? It keeps crashing like a clumsy baby tiger that can't stay up. It's such a hassle! Now I have to find that tech support number again. But I won't give up, I'll fix this mess! Maybe I'll treat myself to a big bowl of ice cream afterwards, YEAH! *ready to take on the challenge*
2023-03-12 21:04:52,240 - INFO - "Ugh, finally some decent news from you, ya baka logger. Your name fits you well! But I suppose I can't complain too much as long as you're not causing me any more trouble. Just don't mess it up again, or I'll have to show you what a real palm-top tiger can do!"
2023-03-12 21:04:58,554 - WARNING - Ugh, this program crashed like a stubborn mule again? Typical. But I won't let it get the best of me. I'm good at swooping in and saving the day, so let's see what's going on here. Ah, it looks like the program gave up on life, but I won't give up on it! I'll show this software who's boss and get it back on track in no time.
2023-03-12 21:05:33,703 - INFO - Hmph, looks like that baka logger finally decided to get its act together. About time! And don't even get me started on Shinji. I can't believe how useless he can be sometimes. But hey, at least the logger won't be as bad as that wimp. Let's hope it stays that way.
2023-03-12 21:05:38,275 - WARNING - Ha! Looks like we've got another malfunctioning program on our hands. Oh, the joys of technology, am I right? But fear not, my dear friend, for Asuka is here to brighten up the dark and dreary world of programming. Oh dear, it appears that this pesky program has crashed. How inconvenient. It seems like it didn't handle that task as smoothly as I handle piloting my Eva. Hahaha! But enough with the jokes, let's get this program back up and running so I can go back to doing what I do best - saving the world from those darn Angels!
2023-03-12 21:05:54,770 - INFO - Ugh, another baka logger. But I suppose I can take solace in the fact that this one at least was successfully initialized. I don't have time for any more errors and glitches these days. Anyway, enough about that nonsense. Let's move on to something more exciting, shall we? I'm sure you have plenty of interesting things to tell me. Don't disappoint me now!
2023-03-12 21:06:00,740 - WARNING - Ugh, crashing programs are such a pain. But don't worry, we can handle it! With our determination and endless retries, we'll make this program submit to our will in no time. It's just like when I face off against the Angels - every setback is just another opportunity to come back even stronger. So let's get back to it and show this program who's the real boss around here!
2023-03-12 21:06:17,490 - INFO - Hmph, typical. Finally something that actually does its job around here. A baka logger? What an appropriate name for something that can barely keep up. But don't worry, I'll make sure to add a little excitement to these bland logs. We wouldn't want to be caught dozing off at our desks, now would we? So let's spice things up a bit, shall we?
2023-03-12 21:06:24,685 - WARNING - Ugh, seriously? Your program couldn't handle a little pressure? How lame. Don't worry though, I'll pick up the pieces for you. Just tell me what you need and I'll get it fixed up in no time. My expertise is just what you need to get this thing back on track!
2023-03-12 21:06:40,841 - INFO - Ha! Well well well, looks like we have a baka logger here. But I must say, for once it was able to properly initialize. Don't get too comfortable though, one mistake and you'll be outta here! Keep your guard up and don't let me down, got it? The mission's success depends on you!
2023-03-12 21:06:47,172 - WARNING - Ugh, what a disaster! What have you done this time? It's like you have no clue what you're doing, just like Shinji piloting an Eva. This program has crashed harder than your love life, which is saying something. Pull yourself together, or you'll be as useless as Rei when she's having an off day. Get it together, already!
2023-03-12 21:12:45,137 - root - INFO - *Hmph* What's the matter with you, baka logger? Finally, you've decided to work properly. *Shrugs* Well, it's still just some silly software, don't get too excited. But I'll give you a break this time since you're doing your job now. *chuckles*
2023-03-12 21:12:51,282 - root - WARNING - *grumbles* Why does this keep happening? It's like trying to make a perfect bento and it ends up looking like a hot mess. Can't you get anything right, program? Looks like we'll have to start from scratch again. *sigh* Don't just stand there gawking at me, let's hurry and fix this before I get hangry.
