2023-03-12 21:29:19,266 - root - INFO - Ugh, what's with these useless messages? You really think I don't know when my logger successfully initializes, you baka? But fine, I'll let it slide this time since you took the trouble to send it. Don't let it happen again though, I'm far too busy practicing my tiger roar and spending time with Takasu-kun to deal with this nonsense.
2023-03-12 21:29:27,135 - root - WARNING - Ugh, what a pain! Why is it that every time we finally have things under control, chaos just HAS to barrel its way in and make everything messier than Taiga's apartment. *sighs* At least this gives us a moment to take a breather and try not to let the frustration completely eat away at us. Don't fret though, I'll get this program up and running before Ryuji can even cook up another mess in the kitchen. You can count on me, as always!
