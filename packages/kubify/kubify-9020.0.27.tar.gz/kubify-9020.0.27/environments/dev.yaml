# dev aws eks environment AND local "run" environment file (BOTH), not used for "start" commands. I will explain in more detail:
# this same file is used for eks kubify-cpu-dev cluster
# this same file is used for local development testing of kubify-cpu-dev cluster (on your workstation using "kubify run", "kubify run [] [] []" or "kubify run-all")
# let me say that again (just to be clear, because this magic is AWESOME):
# to clarify the above: `kubify start` commands = rapid test and listen for code changes
# to clarify the above: `kubify up` commands = use this file and test the built version (so you can rapid test any environment locally with seeds, not with pii data, by copying the file contents here:)
