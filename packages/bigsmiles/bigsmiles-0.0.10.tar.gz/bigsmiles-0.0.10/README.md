**(still under development; but usable)**

**SMILES** (simplified molecular-input line-entry system) representation is a line notation for molecules with 
given deterministic molecular structures. 

**BigSMILES** is an extension to SMILES which provides support for molecules 
that contain stochastic molecular structures. The code here parses the string into and abstract syntax tree.
